<div class="para">In many card games (such as poker) the order in which the cards are drawn is not important (since the player may rearrange the cards in his hand any way he chooses); in the problems that follow, we will assume that this is the case unless otherwise stated. Thus we use combinations to compute the possible number of 5-card hands, <span class="process-math">\(_{52}C_{5}\text{.}\)</span> This number will go in the denominator of our probability formula, since it is the number of possible outcomes.</div>

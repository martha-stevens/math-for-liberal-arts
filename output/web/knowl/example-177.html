<div class="para">The boxplot below is based on the birth weights (in kg) of infants with severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (SIRDS).   The boxplot is separated to show the birth weights of infants who survived and those that did not.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/boxplot4.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="The box for those who survived goes from 1.7 to 2.9 with whiskers extending from 1.15 to 3.6. A line is drawn through the box at 2.3. The box for those who died is drawn from 1.2 to 2.25 with whiskers extending from 1.05 to 2.7. A line is drawn through the box at 1.6."></div>

In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is the same as the third quartile of the infants that died.</div> <div class="para">Similarly, we can see that the first quartile of the survivors is larger than the median weight of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died.</div> <div class="para">Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died.</div> <div class="para">The box plot gives us a quick, albeit informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to survival of infants with SIRDS.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-data-spread.html#example-177" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="para">There is not enough information provided to answer the question, so we will have to make some assumptions, and look up some values.</div> <div class="para">Assumptions:</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">We own a car. Suppose it gets 24 miles to the gallon. We will only consider gas cost.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We will not need to rent a car in Spokane, but will need to get a taxi from the airport to the conference hotel downtown and back.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We can get someone to drop us off at the airport, so we donâ€™t need to consider airport parking.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We will not consider whether we will lose money by having to take time off work to drive.</div></li>
</ol></div> <div class="para">Values looked up (your values may be different)</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Flight cost: $184</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Taxi cost: $25 each way (estimate, according to hotel website)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Driving distance: 280 miles each way</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Gas cost: $3.79 a gallon</div></li>
</ol></div> <div class="para">Cost for flying: $184 flight cost + $50 in taxi fares = $234.</div> <div class="para">Cost for driving: 560 miles round trip will require 23.3 gallons of gas, costing $88.31.</div> <div class="para">Based on these assumptions, driving is cheaper. However, our assumption that we only include gas cost may not be a good one. Tax law allows you deduct $0.55 (in 2012) for each mile driven, a value that accounts for gas as well as a portion of the car cost, insurance, maintenance, etc. Based on this number, the cost of driving would be $319.</div>

<div class="para">Keep in mind that, when you are determining the validity of an argument, you must assume that the premises are true. If you donâ€™t agree with one of the premises, you need to keep your personal opinion out of it. Your job is to pretend that the premises are true and then determine whether they force you to accept the conclusion. You may attack the premises in a court of law or a political discussion, of course, but here we are focusing on the structure of the arguments, not the truth of what they actually say.</div>

<div class="para">To make this decision, we must first decide what our basis for comparison will be. For the purposes of this example, we’ll focus on fuel and purchase costs, but environmental impacts and maintenance costs are other factors a buyer might consider.</div> <div class="para">It might be interesting to compare the cost of gas to run both cars for a year. To determine this, we will need to know the miles per gallon both cars get, as well as the number of miles we expect to drive in a year. From that information, we can find the number of gallons required from a year. Using the price of gas per gallon, we can find the running cost.</div> <div class="para">From Hyundai’s website, the 2013 Sonata will get 24 miles per gallon (mpg) in the city, and 35 mpg on the highway. The hybrid will get 35 mpg in the city, and 40 mpg on the highway.</div> <div class="para">An average driver drives about 12,000 miles a year. Suppose that you expect to drive about 75% of that in the city, so 9,000 city miles a year, and 3,000 highway miles a year.</div> <div class="para">We can then find the number of gallons each car would require for the year.</div> <div class="para">Sonata:</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(9000 \text{ city miles}\cdot \frac{1\text{ gallon}}{24 \text{ city miles}}
+ 3000\text{ hightway miles}\cdot \frac{1\text{ gallon}}{35\text{ highway miles}}=460.7\)</span>gallons.</div> <div class="para">Hybrid:</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(9000 \text{ city miles}\cdot \frac{1\text{ gallon}}{35 \text{ city miles}}
+ 3000\text{ hightway miles}\cdot \frac{1\text{ gallon}}{40\text{ highway miles}}= 332.1\)</span>gallons.</div> <div class="para">If gas in your area averages about $3.50 per gallon, we can use that to find the running cost:</div> <div class="para">Sonata: <span class="process-math">\(460.7 \cdot \$3.50=\$1612.45\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Hybrid:  <span class="process-math">\(332.1 \cdot \$3.50 =\$1162.35\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The hybrid will save $450.10 a year. The gas costs for the hybrid are about <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\$450.10}{\$1612.45}=0.279=27.9\%\)</span> lower than the costs for the standard Sonata.</div> <div class="para">While both the absolute and relative comparisons are useful here, they still make it hard to answer the original question, since “is it worth it” implies there is some tradeoff for the gas savings. Indeed, the hybrid Sonata costs about $25,850, compared to the base model for the regular Sonata, at $20,895.</div> <div class="para">To better answer the “is it worth it” question, we might explore how long it will take the gas savings to make up for the additional initial cost. The hybrid costs $4965 more. With gas savings of $451.10 a year, it will take about 11 years for the gas savings to make up for the higher initial costs.</div> <div class="para">We can conclude that if you expect to own the car 11 years, the hybrid is indeed worth it. If you plan to own the car for less than 11 years, it may still be worth it, since the resale value of the hybrid may be higher, or for other non-monetary reasons. This is a case where math can help guide your decision, but it can’t make it for you.</div>

<div class="para">Human height is commonly considered an approximately normally distributed measure. If the mean height of a male adult in the U.S.A. is 5'10", with a standard deviation of 1.5", how common are men with heights greater than 6'2"?</div>
<div class="para">Since each standard deviation of this normally distributed data is 1.5", and 6'2" is 4" above the mean for the population, 6'2" is nearly 3 standard deviations above the mean. That tells us that men taller than 6'2" are quite rare in this population.</div>

<div class="para">If the fuel mileage of a particular model of car is normally distributed, with a mean of 26 mpg and a standard deviation of 2 mpg, how common are cars with a fuel efficiency of 24 to 25 mpg?</div>
<div class="para">We know that approximately 68% of the cars in the population have an efficiency of between 24 and 28 mpg, since that would be 1 SD below and 1 SD above the mean. That suggests that apx 34% have an efficiency of 24 to 26 mpg, so we can say that it is uncommon to see a car with an efficiency between 24 and 25 mpg, but not extremely so.</div>

<div class="para">If the maximum jumping height of U.S. high school high jumpers is normally distributed with a mean of 5'11.5" and a SD of 2.2", how unusual is it to see a high school jumper clear 6'3"?</div>
<div class="para">If the mean is 5'11.5", then 1 SD above is 6'1.7" and 2 SDâ€™s is 6'3.9". That means that less than 2.5% of jumpers 6'3.9", so it would be pretty uncommon to see a high-school competitor exceed 6'3".</div>

<li><div class="para">This number is hard to evaluate, since we have no basis for judging whether this is a larger or small change.  If the number of “dropout factories” dropped from 20 to 3, that’d be a very significant change, but if the number dropped from 217 to 200, that’d be less of an improvement.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The last sentence provides relative change which helps put the first sentence in perspective.  We can estimate that the number of “dropout factories” was probably previously around 34.  However, it’s possible that students simply moved schools rather than the school improving, so that estimate might not be fully accurate.</div></li>

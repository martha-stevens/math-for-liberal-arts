</h3> <div class="para">You may recognize the common difference, d, in our linear equation as slope. In fact, the entire explicit equation should look familiar - it is the same linear equation you learned in algebra, probably stated as <span class="process-math">\(y = mx + b\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">In the standard algebraic equation <span class="process-math">\(y = mx + b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> was the y-intercept, or the y value when x was zero. In the form of the equation we’re using, we are using <span class="process-math">\(P_0\)</span> to represent that initial amount.</div> <div class="para">In the <span class="process-math">\(y = mx + b\)</span> equation, recall that m was the slope. You might remember this as “rise over run”, or the change in y divided by the change in x. Either way, it represents the same thing as the common difference, <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> we are using - the amount the output Pn changes when the input n increases by 1.</div> <div class="para">The equations <span class="process-math">\(y = mx + b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P_n = P_0 + d n\)</span> mean the same thing and can be used the same ways, we’re just writing it somewhat differently.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-algebra-linear.html#note-14" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

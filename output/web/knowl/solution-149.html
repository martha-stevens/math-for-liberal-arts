<div class="para">It might seem that you could use the formula for the probability of two independent events and simply multiply  <span class="process-math">\(\frac{4}{52}\cdot \frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{169}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">This would be incorrect, however, because the two events are not independent. If the first card drawn is an ace, then the probability that the second card is also an ace would be lower because there would only be three aces left in the deck.</div> <div class="para">Once the first card chosen is an ace, the probability that the second card chosen is also an ace is called the conditional probability of drawing an ace. In this case the "condition" is that the first card is an ace. Symbolically, we write this as:</div> <div class="para">P(ace on second draw | an ace on the first draw).</div> <div class="para">The vertical bar "|" is read as "given," so the above expression is short for "The probability that an ace is drawn on the second draw given that an ace was drawn on the first draw." What is this probability? After an ace is drawn on the first draw, there are 3 aces out of 51 total cards left. This means that the conditional probability of drawing an ace after one ace has already been drawn is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{17}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Thus, the probability of both cards being aces is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{4}{52}\cdot \frac{3}{51}=
\frac{12}{2652}=\frac{1}{221}\text{.}\)</span>

<h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Quotation</span></h4>If you knew that the prices of t-shirts sold in an online shopping site were normally distributed, and had a mean cost of $10, with a standard deviation of $1.50, how could that information benefit you as you are looking at various t-shirt styles and designs on the site? How could you use what you know if you were looking to make a profit by purchasing unusually inexpensive shirts to resell at prices that are more common?</blockquote>

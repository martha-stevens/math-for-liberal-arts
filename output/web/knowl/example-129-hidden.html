<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers[1]. This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily ensure that the study was biased, it certainly suggests that we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.</div></article></body>

<div class="para">This is the criteria used in much political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a "likely voter." Is it someone who voted in the last election? In the last general election? In the last presidential election? Should we consider someone who just turned 18 a "likely voter?" They weren't eligible to vote in the past, so how do we judge the likelihood that they will vote in the next election?</div>

               <introduction>
                <p>Populations of people, animals, and items are growing all around us. By understanding how
                    things grow, we can better understand what to expect in the future. In this chapter, we focus
                    on time-dependant change.</p>

                <p>Marco is a collector of antique soda bottles. His collection currently contains 437 bottles.
                Every year, he budgets enough money to buy 32 new bottles. Can we determine how many
                bottles he will have in 5 years, and how long it will take for his collection to reach 1000
                bottles?</p>

                <p>While both of these questions you could probably solve without an equation or formal
mathematics, we are going to formalize our approach to this problem to provide a means to
answer more complicated questions.</p>

<p>Suppose that <m>P_n</m> represents the number, or population, of bottles Marco has after n years. So
<m>P_0</m> would represent the number of bottles now, <m>P_1</m> would represent the number of bottles after
1 year, <m>P_2</m> would represent the number of bottles after 2 years, and so on. We could describe
how Marco’s bottle collection is changing using:</p>

<p><m>P_0 = 437</m></p>
<p><m>P_n = P_{n-1} + 32</m></p>

<p>This is called a recursive relationship. A recursive relationship is a formula which relates
the next value in a sequence to the previous values. Here, the number of bottles in year n can
be found by adding 32 to the number of bottles in the previous year, <m>P_{n-1}</m>. Using this
relationship, we could calculate:</p>

<p><m>P_1 = P_0 + 32 = 437 + 32 = 469</m></p>
<p><m>P_2 = P_1 + 32 = 469 + 32 = 501</m></p>
<p><m>P_3 = P_2 + 32 = 501 + 32 = 533</m></p>
<p><m>P_4 = P_3 + 32 = 533 + 32 = 565</m></p>
<p><m>P_5 = P_4 + 32 = 565 + 32 = 597</m></p>

<p>We have answered the question of how many bottles Marco will have in 5 years. However,
solving how long it will take for his collection to reach 1000 bottles would require a lot more
calculations.</p>

<p>While recursive relationships are excellent for describing simply and cleanly how a quantity
is changing, they are not convenient for making predictions or solving problems that stretch
far into the future. For that, a closed or explicit form for the relationship is preferred. An
explicit equation allows us to calculate <m>P_n</m> directly, without needing to know <m>P_{n-1}</m>. While
you may already be able to guess the explicit equation, let us derive it from the recursive
formula. We can do so by selectively not simplifying as we go:</p>

                <p><m>P_1 = 437 + 32 = 437 + 1(32)</m></p>
<p><m>P_2 = P_1 + 32 = 437 + 32 + 32 = 437 + 2(32)</m></p>
<p><m>P_3 = P_2 + 32 = (437 + 2(32)) + 32 = 437 + 3(32)</m></p>
<p><m>P_4 = P_3 + 32 = (437 + 3(32)) + 32 = 437 + 4(32)</m></p>

<p>You can probably see the pattern now, and generalize that</p>
<p><m>P_n = 437 + n(32) = 437 + 32n</m></p>

<p>Using this equation, we can calculate how many bottles he’ll have after 5 years:</p>
<p><m>P_5 = 437 + 32(5) = 437 + 160 = 597</m></p>

<p>We can now also solve for when the collection will reach 1000 bottles by substituting in
1000 for Pn and solving for n</p>

<p><m>1000 = 437 + 32n</m></p>
<p><m>563 = 32n</m></p>
<p><m>n = 563 \div 32 = 17.59</m></p>

<p>So Marco will reach 1000 bottles in 18 years.</p>

In the previous example, Marco’s collection grew by<p>
the same number of bottles every year. This constant
change is the defining characteristic of linear growth.
Plotting the values we calculated for Marco’s
collection, we can see the values form a straight line,
the shape of linear growth.</p>

<definition><title>Linear Growth</title>
<p>If a quantity starts at size P0 and grows by d every time period, then the quantity after n
time periods can be determined using either of these relations:</p>
<p>Recursive form: <m>P_n = P_{n-1} + d</m></p>
<p>Explicit form: <m>P_n = P_0 + d n</m></p>
<p>In this equation, <m>d</m> represents the common difference - the amount that the population
changes each time n increases by 1</p>
</definition>

<note><title>Connection to Prior Learning</title>
<p>You may recognize the common difference, d, in our linear equation as slope. In fact, the
entire explicit equation should look familiar - it is the same linear equation you learned in
algebra, probably stated as <m>y = mx + b</m>.</p>

<p>In the standard algebraic equation <m>y = mx + b</m>, <m>b</m> was the y-intercept, or the y value when x
was zero. In the form of the equation we’re using, we are using <m>P_0</m> to represent that initial
amount.</p>

<p>In the <m>y = mx + b</m> equation, recall that m was the slope. You might remember this as “rise
over run”, or the change in y divided by the change in x. Either way, it represents the same
thing as the common difference, <m>d</m>, we are using - the amount the output Pn changes when
the input n increases by 1.</p>

<p>The equations <m>y = mx + b</m> and <m>P_n = P_0 + d n</m> mean the same thing and can be used the same
ways, we’re just writing it somewhat differently.</p>

</note>

<example>
    <p>The population of elk in a national forest was measured to be 12,000 in 2003, and was
    measured again to be 15,000 in 2007. If the population continues to grow linearly at this
    rate, what will the elk population be in 2014?</p>

    <solution><p>To begin, we need to define how we’re going to measure <m>n</m>. Remember that <m>P_0</m> is the
    population when <m>n = 0</m>, so we probably don’t want to literally use the year 0. Since we
    already know the population in 2003, let us define <m>n = 0</m> to be the year 2003. Then
    <m>P_0 = 12,000</m>.</p>
        
    <p>Next we need to find <m>d</m>. Remember <m>d</m> is the growth per time period, in this case growth per
    year. Between the two measurements, the population grew by <m>15,000-12,000 = 3,000</m>, but it
    took 2007-2003 = 4 years to grow that much. To find the growth per year, we can divide:
    <m>\frac{3000\text{ elk}}{4\text{ years}} = 750</m> elk in 1 year.</p>
        
    <p>Alternatively, you can use the slope formula from algebra to determine the common
    difference, noting that the population is the output of the formula, and time is the input.</p>
        
    <me>d = \text{slope}=\frac{\text{change in output}}{\text{change in input}}=\frac{15000-12000}{2007 -2003}=
    \frac{3000}{4}=750</me>
        
    <p>We can now write our equation in whichever form is preferred.</p>
    <p>Recursive form: 
        <md><mrow>P_0 \amp = 12,000</mrow>
        <mrow>P_n \amp = P_{n-1} + 750</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
        
    <p>Explicit form:
        <me>P_n = 12,000 + 750n</me>
    </p>
        
    <p>To answer the question, we need to first note that the year 2014 will be <m>n = 11</m>, since 2014 is
    11 years after 2003. The explicit form will be easier to use for this calculation:</p>
    <p><m>P_{11} = 12,000 + 750(11) = 20,250</m> elk</p>
    </solution>

    <p>While there are more advanced statistical
    techniques that can be used to find an equation
    to model the data, to get an idea of what is
    happening, we can find an equation by using
    two pieces of the data - perhaps the data from
    1993 and 2003.</p>

    <p>Letting <m>n = 0</m> correspond with 1993 would
    give <m>P_0 = 111</m> billion gallons.</p>

    <p>To find <m>d</m>, we need to know how much the gas consumption increased each year, on average.
    From 1993 to 2003 the gas consumption increased from 111 billion gallons to 133 billion
    gallons, a total change of <m>133 - 111 = 22</m> billion gallons, over 10 years. This gives us an
    average change of <m>22 \text{ billion gallons} \div 10 \text{ year} = 2.2</m> billion gallons per year.</p>

    <p>Equivalently,
    <me>
        d = \frac{\text{change in output}}{\text{change in input}}=\frac{133 - 111}{10-0}=\frac{22}{10} = 2.2</me>

<p>We can now use our model to make predictions about the future, assuming that the previous
trend continues unchanged. To predict the gasoline consumption in 2016:</p>

<p><m>n = 23</m> (2016 - 1993 = 23 years later)</p>
<p><m>P_{23} = 111 + 2.2(23) = 161.6</m></p>

<p>Our model predicts that the US will consume 161.6 billion gallons of gasoline in 2016 if the
current trend continues.</p>

<p>To find when the consumption will reach 200 billion gallons, we would set <m>P_n = 200</m>, and
solve for n:</p>

<p>
    <md>
        <mrow>111 + 2.2n \amp = 200</mrow>
        <mrow>111 + 2.2n - 111 \amp = 200 - 111</mrow>
        <mrow>2.2n \amp = 89</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{2.2n}{2.2} \amp = \frac{89}{2.2}</mrow>
        <mrow>n \amp = 40.4545</mrow>
    </md>
</p>


<p>This tells us that consumption will reach 200 billion about 40 years after 1993, which would
be in the year 2033.</p>

    equation <m>P_n = 70 + 30n</m>. What does this equation tell us?</p>

    <solution><p>The value for <m>P_0</m> in this equation is 70, so the initial starting cost is $70. This tells us that
    there must be an initiation or start-up fee of $70 to join the gym.</p>
    <p>The value for <m>d</m> in the equation is 30, so the cost increases by $30 each month. This tells us
    that the monthly membership fee for the gym is $30 a month.</p></solution>

<note><title>When good models go bad</title>
<p>When using mathematical models to predict future behavior, it is important to keep in mind
that very few trends will continue indefinitely.</p>
</note>

<example>
    <p>Suppose a four year old boy is currently 39 inches tall, and you are told to expect him to
grow 2.5 inches a year.</p>
<p>We can set up a growth model, with <m>n = 0</m> corresponding to 4 years old.</p>
<p>Recursive form:</p>
<md>
<mrow>P_0 \amp = 39</mrow>
<mrow>P_n \amp = P_{n-1} + 2.5</mrow>
</md>

<p>Explicit form:</p>
<me>P_n = 39 + 2.5n</me>

<p>So at 6 years old, we would expect him to be <m>P_2 = 39 + 2.5(2) = 44</m> inches tall.</p>

<p>Any mathematical model will break down eventually. Certainly, we shouldn’t expect this
boy to continue to grow at the same rate all his life. If he did, at age 50 he would be
<m>P_{46} = 39 + 2.5(46) = 154</m> inches tall = 12.8 feet tall!
</p>
</example>

<p>When using any mathematical model, we have to consider which inputs are reasonable to
use. Whenever we extrapolate, or make predictions into the future, we are assuming the
model will continue to be valid.</p>

                       <li>Graph exponential models</li>

    <p>Suppose that every year, only 10% of the fish in a lake have surviving offspring. If there
were 100 fish in the lake last year, there would now be 110 fish. If there were 1000 fish in
the lake last year, there would now be 1100 fish. Absent any inhibiting factors, populations
of people and animals tend to grow by a percent of the existing population each year.</p>

<p>Suppose our lake began with 1000 fish, and 10% of the fish have surviving offspring each
year. Since we start with 1000 fish, <m>P_0 = 1000</m>. How do we calculate <m>P_1</m>? The new
population will be the old population, plus an additional 10%. Symbolically:</p>

<p><m>P_1 = P_0 + 0.10P_0</m></p>

<p>Notice this could be condensed to a shorter form by factoring:</p>

<p><m>P_1 = P_0 + 0.10P_0 = 1P_0 + 0.10P_0 = (1+ 0.10)P_0 = 1.10P_0</m></p>

<p>While 10% is the growth rate, 1.10 is the growth multiplier. Notice that 1.10 can be
thought of as “the original 100% plus an additional 10%”</p>

<p>For our fish population,</p>

<p><m>P_1 = 1.10(1000) = 1100</m></p>

<p>We could then calculate the population in later years:</p>

<p><m>P_2 = 1.10P_1 = 1.10(1100) = 1210</m></p>
<p><m>P_3 = 1.10P_2 = 1.10(1210) = 1331</m></p>

<p>Notice that in the first year, the population grew by 100 fish, in the second year, the
population grew by 110 fish, and in the third year the population grew by 121 fish.
While there is a constant percentage growth, the actual increase in number of fish is
increasing each year.</p>

<p>Graphing these values we see that this growth
doesn’t quite appear linear.</p>

<p>To get a better picture of how this percentagebased growth affects things, we need an explicit
form, so we can quickly calculate values further
out in the future.</p>

<p>Like we did for the linear model, we will start
building from the recursive equation:</p>

<p><m>P_1 = 1.10P_0 = 1.10 \cdot 1000</m></p>
<p><m>P_2 = 1.10P_1 = 1.10 \cdot 1.10 \cdot 1000 = 1.10^2 \cdot 1000</m></p>
<p><m>P_3 = 1.10P_2 = 1.10 \cdot 1.10^2 \cdot 1000 = 1.10^3 \cdot 1000</m></p>
<p><m>P_4 = 1.10P_3 = 1.10 \cdot 1.10^3 \cdot 1000 = 1.10^4 \cdot 1000</m></p>

<p>Observing a pattern, we can generalize the explicit form to be:</p>
<p><m>P_n = 1.10^n \cdot 1000</m>, or equivalently, <m>P_n = 1000 \left(1.10 \right)^n</m></p>

<p>From this, we can quickly calculate the number of fish
in 10, 20, or 30 years:</p>

<p><m>P_{10} = 1000 \left(1.10 \right)^{10} = 2594</m></p>
<p><m>P_{20} = 1000 \left( 1.10 \right)^{20} = 6727</m></p>
<p><m>P_{30} = 1000 \left( 1.10 \right)^{30} = 17449</m></p>

<p>Adding these values to our graph reveals a shape that is
definitely not linear. If our fish population had been
growing linearly, by 100 fish each year, the population
would have only reached 4000 in 30 years compared to
almost 18000 with this percent-based growth, called exponential growth.</p>

<p>In exponential growth, the population grows proportional to the size of the population, so as
the population gets larger, the same percent growth will yield a larger numeric growth.</p>

<definition><title>Exponential Growth</title>
<p>If a quantity starts at size <m>P_0</m> and grows by <m>R\%</m> (written as a decimal, <m>r</m>) every time
period, then the quantity after <m>n</m> time periods can be determined using either of these
relations:</p>

<p>Recursive form:</p>
<p><m>P_n = \left(1+r \right) P_{n-1}</m></p>

<p>Explicit form:</p>
<p><m>P_n = P_0 \left(1+r \right)^n</m></p>

<p>We call <m>r</m> the <term>growth rate</term>.</p>

<p>The term <m>\left(1+r \right)</m> is called the <term>growth multiplier</term>, or common ratio.</p>
</definition>

<example>
<p>Between 2007 and 2008, Olympia, WA grew almost 3% to a population of 245 thousand
people. If this growth rate was to continue, what would the population of Olympia be in
2014?</p>

<solution><p>As we did before, we first need to define what year will correspond to <m>n = 0</m>. Since we know
the population in 2008, it would make sense to have 2008 correspond to <m>n = 0</m>, so <m>P_0 =
245000</m>. The year 2014 would then be <m>n = 6</m>.</p>

<p>We know the growth rate is 3%, giving <m>r = 0.03</m>.</p>

<p>Using the explicit form:</p>
<p><m>P_6 = \left( 1+0.03 \right)^6 (245,000) = 1.19405(245,000) = 292,542.25</m></p>
<p>The model predicts that in 2014, Olympia would have a population of about 293 thousand
people.</p>

    <example>
        <p>A friend is using the equation <m>P_n = 4600 \left(1.072 \right)^n</m> to predict the annual tuition at a local
            college. She says the formula is based on years after 2010. What does this equation tell us?</p>
        
        <solution><p>In the equation, <m>P_0 = 4600</m>, which is the starting value of the tuition when <m>n = 0</m>. This tells us
            that the tuition in 2010 was $4,600.</p>

            <p>The growth multiplier is 1.072, so the growth rate is 0.072, or 7.2%. This tells us that the
                tuition is expected to grow by 7.2% each year.</p>
            
            <p>Putting this together, we could say that the tuition in 2010 was $4,600, and is expected to
                grow by 7.2% each year.</p>
        </solution>
        
    </example>
    
    <example>
        <p>In 1990, the residential energy use in the US was responsible for 962 million metric tons of
        carbon dioxide emissions. By the year 2000, that number had risen to 1182 million metric
            tons. If the emissions grow exponentially and continue at the same rate, what will the
            emissions grow to by 2050?</p>
        
        <solution><p>Similar to before, we will correspond <m>n = 0</m> with 1990, as that is the year for the first piece of
            data we have. That will make <m>P_0 = 962</m> (million metric tons of CO2). In this problem, we are
            not given the growth rate, but instead are given that <m>P_{10} = 1182</m>.</p>
            
            <p>When <m>n = 10</m>, the explicit equation looks like:</p>
            <p><m>P_{10} = P_0 \left(1+r \right)^{10}</m></p>
            
            <p>We know the value for <m>P_0</m>, so we can put that into the equation:</p>
            <p><m>P_{10} = 962 \left(1+r \right)^{10}</m></p>
            <p>We also know that <m>P_{10} = 1182</m>, so substituting that in, we get</p>
            <p><m>1182 = 962 \left(1+r \right)^{10}</m></p>
            <p>We can now solve this equation for the growth rate, r. Start by dividing by 962.</p>
            <me>\frac{1182}{962} = \left( 1 + r \right)^{10}</me>
            <p>Then take the 10th root of both sides:</p>
            <me> \sqrt[10]{\frac{1182}{962}}=1 + r</me>
            <p>Finally subtract 1 from both sides</p>
            <me>r = \sqrt[10]{\frac{1182}{962}}-1</me>
            <me>r = 0.0208 =  2.08\%</me>

            <p>So if the emissions are growing exponentially, they are growing by about 2.08% per year.
                We can now predict the emissions in 2050 by finding <m>P_{60}</m></p>
                
                <p><m>P_{60} = 962\left( 1+0.0208n \right)^{60} = 3308.4</m> million metric tons of CO2 in 2050</p>
                </solution>
                </example>
    
    <note><title>Rounding</title>
        <p>As a note on rounding, notice that if we had rounded the growth rate to 2.1%, our
        calculation for the emissions in 2050 would have been 3347. Rounding to 2% would
        have changed our result to 3156. A very small difference in the growth rates gets
        magnified greatly in exponential growth. For this reason, it is recommended to round
            the growth rate as little as possible.</p>
        
        <p>If you need to round, keep at least three significant digits - numbers after any leading
        zeros. So 0.4162 could be reasonably rounded to 0.416. A growth rate of 0.001027
        could be reasonably rounded to 0.00103.</p>

    <note><title>Evaluating Roots on the calculator</title>
        <p>In the previous example, we had to calculate the 10th root of a number. This is
        different than taking the basic square root, <m>\sqrt{}</m>. Many scientific calculators have a button
            for general roots. It is typically labeled like:</p>
        
        <p><m>\sqrt[n]{}</m>, <m>\sqrt[x]{}</m>, or <m>\sqrt[y]{x}</m></p>
        
        <p>To evaluate the 3rd root of 8, for example, we’d either type 3 <m>\sqrt[n]{}</m> 8, or 8 <m>\sqrt[n]{}</m> 3,
        depending on the calculator. Try it on yours to see which to use - you should get an
            answer of 2.</p>
        
        <p>If your calculator does not have a general root button, all is not lost. You can instead
            use the property of exponents which states that <m>\sqrt[n]{a} = a^{1/n}</m></p>

        <p>So, to compute the 3rd root of 8, you could use your calculator’s exponent key to evaluate <m>8^{1/3}</m>. 
            To do this, type:</p>
        
        <p>8 ^ (1/3)</p>

        <p>The parentheses tell the calculator to divide 1/3 before doing the exponent.</p>

    <example>
        <p>Looking back at the last example, for the sake of comparison, what would the carbon
            emissions be in 2050 if emissions grow linearly at the same rate?</p>
        
        <solution><p>Again we will get <m>n = 0</m> correspond with 1990, giving <m>P_0 = 962</m>. 
            To find <m>d</m>, we could take the same approach as earlier, noting that the emissions increased by 
            220 million metric tons in 10 years, giving a common difference of 22 million metric tons each year.</p>
            
            <p>Alternatively, we could use an approach similar to that which we used to find the exponential
                equation. When <m>n = 10</m>, the explicit linear equation looks like:</p>
                    
            <me>P_{10} = P_0 + 10d</me>
            
            <p>We know the value for <m>P_0</m>, so we can put that into the equation:</p>
                
            <me>P_{10} = 962 + 10d</me>
            
            <p>Since we know that <m>P_{10} = 1182</m>, substituting that in we get</p>
            
            <me>1182 = 962 + 10d</me>
            
            <p>We can now solve this equation for the common difference, d.</p>
            
            <me>1182 - 962 = 10d</me>
            <me>220 = 10d</me>
            <me>d = 22</me>
            
            <p>This tells us that if the emissions are changing
            linearly, they are growing by 22 million metric
                tons each year.</p>
                
            <p>Predicting the emissions in 2050,<m>P_{60} = 962 + 22(60) = 2282</m> million metric tons.</p>
            
            <p>You will notice that this number is substantially
            smaller than the prediction from the exponential
            growth model. Calculating and plotting more
                values helps illustrate the differences.</p>

              <description>The linear and exponential models are closer together when n is small. But as n gets

    <p>So how do we know which growth model to use
        when working with data? There are two approaches which should be used together whenever
        possible:</p>
    
    <p>
    
    <ol label = "1">
        <li>Find more than two pieces of data. Plot the values, and look for a trend. Does the
            data appear to be changing like a line, or do the values appear to be curving upwards?</li>
        <li>Consider the factors contributing to the data. Are they things you would expect to
        change linearly or exponentially? For example, in the case of carbon emissions, we
        could expect that, absent other factors, they would be tied closely to population
            values, which tend to change exponentially.</li>

    <introduction>
        <p>A used-car company has just offered their best candidate, Nicole, a position in sales. The position offers 16% commission on her sales. Her earnings depend on the amount of her sales. For instance, if she sells a vehicle for $4,600, she will earn $736. She wants to evaluate the offer, but she is not sure how. In this section, we will look at relationships, such as this one, between earnings, sales, and commission rate.</p>
    </introduction>
        
        <subsection><title>Solving Direct Variation Problems</title>
            
            
            <p>In the example above, Nicole’s earnings can be found by multiplying her sales by her commission. The formula 
                <m>e=0.16s</m> tells us her earnings, <m>e</m>, come from the product of 0.16, her commission, and the sale 
                price of the vehicle. If we create a table, we observe that as the sales price increases, the earnings increase 
                as well, which should be intuitive.

            </table>
            
            <p>Notice that earnings are a multiple of sales. As sales increase, earnings increase in a predictable way. Double the 
                sales of the vehicle from $4,600 to $9,200, and we double the earnings from $736 to $1,472. As the input increases, the 
                output increases as a multiple of the input. A relationship in which one quantity is a constant multiplied by another 
                quantity is called direct variation. Each variable in this type of relationship varies directly with the other.</p>

            <p>The figure below represents the data for Nicole’s potential earnings. We say that earnings vary directly with the sales 
                price of the car. The formula <m>y=kx^n</m> is used for direct variation. The value <m>k</m> is a nonzero constant 
                greater than zero and is called the constant of variation. In this case, <m>k = 0.16</m> and <m>n = 1</m>. </p>
            
            <definition><title>Direct Variation</title>
                <p>If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are related by an equation of the form</p>
                <me>y = kx^n</me>
                
                <p>then we say that the relationship is <term>direct variation</term> and <m>y</m> varies directly with, or is 
                    proportional to, the nth power of <m>x</m>. In direct variation relationships, there is a nonzero constant 
                    ratio <m>k = \frac{y}{x^n}</m>, where <m>k</m> is called the <term>constant of variation</term>, 
                    which help defines the relationship between the variables.</p>

        <p>We notice in the relationship between these variables that, as one quantity increases, the other decreases.

        <p>For our example, the figure depicts the inverse variation. We say the water temperature varies inversely

        <example>
            <p>The volume of a gas held at constant temperature varies inversely as the pressure of the gas. 
                If the volume of a gas is 1200 cubic centimeters when the pressure is 200 millimeters of mercury, 
                what is the volume when the pressure is 300 millimeters of mercury?</p>
            
            <solution>
                <p>We can expression the fact that "volume varies <em>inversely</em> as pressure" with the equation,
                    <me>V = \frac{k}{P}</me>
                </p>
                
                <p>Use the <m>V = 1200</m> when <m>P = 200</m> to solve for <m>k</m>:
                    <me>1200 = \frac{k}{200}</me>
                    <me>200 \cdot 1200 = \frac{k}{200} \cdot 200</me>
                    <me>k = 240,000</me>
                </p>
                
                <p>We can write the relationship,
                    <me>V = \frac{240,000}{P}</me>
                    and plug in <m>P = 300</m> to find the volume when pressure is 300 millimeters of mercury.</p>
                
                <me>V = \frac{240,000}{300}</me>
                <me>V = 800</me>

            <statement>
                <p>The time it takes to drive to Grand Junction is inversely proportional to your average speed. If Justin averages 60mph, it will take him 4 hours to make the drive.
                    <ol label = "a">
                        <li>Write an equation that models this situation.</li>
                        <li>If Justin hits traffic and averages 50 mph, how long will it take him to the make the drive?</li>

                     <ol label = "a">
                         <li>Time varies inversely as speed is the relationship, <m>T = \frac{k}{S}</m>. 
                             Plug in <m>S = 60</m> and <m>T = 4</m> and solve for k:
                             <me>4 = \frac{k}{60}</me>
                             <me>4 \cdot 60 = \frac{k}{60} \cdot 60</me>
                             <me>k = 240</me>
                             <me>T = \frac{240}{S}</me>

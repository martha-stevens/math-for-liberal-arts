<div class="para">To address this question, we will first need data. From the CIA website we can find the electricity consumption in 2011 for China was 4,693,000,000,000 KWH (kilowatt-hours), or 4.693 trillion KWH, while the consumption for Japan was 859,700,000,000, or 859.7 billion KWH.  To find the rate per capita (per person), we will also need the population of the two countries.   From the World Bank, we can find the population of China is 1,344,130,000, or 1.344 billion, and the population of Japan is 127,817,277, or 127.8 million.</div> <div class="para">Computing the consumption per capita for each country:</div> <div class="para">China: <span class="process-math">\(\frac{4,693,000,000,000 \text{ KWH}}{1,344,130,000 \text{ people}} =3491.5\)</span> KWH per person</div> <div class="para">Japan: <span class="process-math">\(\frac{859,700,000,000 \text{ KWH}}{127,817,277 \text{ people}}= 6726\)</span> KWH per person</div> <div class="para">While China uses more than 5 times the electricity of Japan overall, because the population of Japan is so much smaller, it turns out Japan uses almost twice the electricity per person compared to China.</div>

<div class="para">A researcher wants to study the effectiveness of a "test-taking-energy-drink". They select 1,000 volunteers from colleges around the country and divide them into two groups. Those enrolled in English classes were given the real drink, and those enrolled in math classes were given a fake drink. None of the students knew which drink they were getting, but the researchers knew.

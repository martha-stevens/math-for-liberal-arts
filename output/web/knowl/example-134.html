<div class="para">A telephone poll asks the question “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?”, and 50% of the people called refused to answer the survey. It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias, introduced by people refusing to participate in a study or dropping out of an experiment. When people refuse to participate, we can no longer be so certain that our sample is representative of the population.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-stats-samplingmethods.html#example-134" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="para">There are several approaches we could take.  We’ll use one based on triangles, which requires that it’s a sunny day.  Suppose the tree is casting a shadow, say 15 ft long.  I can then have a friend help me measure my own shadow.  Suppose I am 6 ft tall, and cast a 1.5 ft shadow.  Since the triangle formed by the tree and its shadow has the same angles as the triangle formed by me and my shadow, these triangles are called <dfn class="terminology">similar triangles</dfn> and their sides will scale proportionally.  In other words, the ratio of height to width will be the same in both triangles.  Using this, we can find the height of the tree, which we’ll denote by h.</div>

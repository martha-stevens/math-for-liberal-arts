</h3> <div class="para">As a note on rounding, notice that if we had rounded the growth rate to 2.1%, our calculation for the emissions in 2050 would have been 3347. Rounding to 2% would have changed our result to 3156. A very small difference in the growth rates gets magnified greatly in exponential growth. For this reason, it is recommended to round the growth rate as little as possible.</div> <div class="para">If you need to round, keep at least three significant digits - numbers after any leading zeros. So 0.4162 could be reasonably rounded to 0.416. A growth rate of 0.001027 could be reasonably rounded to 0.00103.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-algebra-exponential.html#note-17" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

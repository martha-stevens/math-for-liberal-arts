<div class="para">To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to know the loan payments, if we donâ€™t already know them. Remember that only a portion of your loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will not have paid off $12,000 of the loan balance.</div>

<div class="para">A survey about the movie you most recently attended includes the question "How would you rate the movie you just saw?" with these possible answers:</div> <div class="para">1 - it was awful</div> <div class="para">2 - it was just OK</div> <div class="para">3 - I liked it</div> <div class="para">4 - it was great</div> <div class="para">5 - best movie ever!</div> <div class="para">Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but we can't really do any calculations with them: a movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; if two people see the movie and one of them thinks it stinks and the other thinks it's the best ever it doesn't necessarily make sense to say that "on average they liked it."</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-stats-samples.html#example-121" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

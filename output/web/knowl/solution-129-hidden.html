<div class="para">In this case we need to choose 10 of the 15 Republicans and 9 of the 14 Democrats. There are <span class="process-math">\(_{15}C_{10} = 3003\)</span> ways to choose the 10 Republicans and <span class="process-math">\(_{14}C_{9} = 2002\)</span> ways to choose the 9 Democrats. But now what? How do we finish the problem?</div> <div class="para">Suppose we listed all of the possible 10-member Republican groups on 3003 slips of red paper and all of the possible 9-member Democratic groups on 2002 slips of blue paper. How many ways can we choose one red slip and one blue slip? This is a job for the Basic Counting Rule! We are simply making one choice from the first category and one choice from the second category, just like in the restaurant menu problems from earlier.</div> <div class="para">There must be <span class="process-math">\(3003 \cdot 2002 = 6,012,006\)</span> possible ways of selecting the members of the Defense Subcommittee.</div>

The difference in the vertical scale on the first graph suggests a different story than the true differences in percentages; the second graph makes it look like twice as many people oppose marriage rights as support it.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/120_Data_Screenshot6.png" class="contained" alt="The first graph has a bar labeled support that starts at 0 and ends at 45 and a bar labeled oppose that starts at 0 and ends at 55.

<div class="para">Let T be the set of all people who have used Twitter, and F be the set of all people who have used Facebook. Notice that while the cardinality of F is 70% and the cardinality of T is 40%, the cardinality of <span class="process-math">\(F \cup T\)</span> is not simply 70% + 40%, since that would count those who use both services twice. To find the cardinality of <span class="process-math">\(F \cup T\text{,}\)</span> we can add the cardinality of F and the cardinality of T, then subtract those in intersection that weâ€™ve counted twice.

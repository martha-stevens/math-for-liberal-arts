<div class="para">By knowing the mean and SD of the shirt prices, and knowing that they are normally distributed, you can estimate right away if a shirt is priced at a point significantly below the norm. For instance, with this data, we can estimate that a shirt priced at $7.00 is less expensive than apx 97.5% of all shirts on the site, and could likely be resold at a profit (assuming there is not something wrong the shirt that is not obvious from the listing).</div>

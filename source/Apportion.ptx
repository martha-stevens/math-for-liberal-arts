    <title>Apportionment</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>Apportionment is the problem of dividing up a fixed number of things among groups of different sizes. In politics, this takes the form of allocating a limited number of representatives amongst voters. This problem, presumably, is older than the United States, but the best-known ways to solve it have their origins in the problem of assigning each state an appropriate number of representatives in the new Congress when the country was formed. States also face this apportionment problem in defining how to draw districts for state representatives. The apportionment problem comes up in a variety of non-political areas too, though. We face several restrictions in this process:</p>

        <note><title>Apportionment Rules</title>
            <p>
<ol label ="1">
    <li>The things being divided up can exist only in whole numbers.</li>
    <li>We must use all of the things being divided up, and we cannot use any more.</li>
    <li>Each group must get at least one of the things being divided up.</li>
    <li>The number of things assigned to each group should be at least approximately proportional to the population of the 
        group. (Exact proportionality isn’t possible because of the whole number requirement, but we should try to be close, 
        and in any case, if Group A is larger than Group B, then Group B shouldn’t get more of the things than Group A 
        does.)</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </note>
        
        <p>In terms of the apportionment of the United States House of Representatives, these rules imply:</p>
        <p>
        <ol label = "1">
            <li>We can only have whole representatives (a state can’t have 3.4 representatives)</li>
            <li>We can only use the (currently) 435 representatives available. If one state gets another representative, 
                another state has to lose one.</li>
            <li>Every state gets at least one representative</li>
            <li>The number of representatives each state gets should be approximately proportional to the state population. 
                This way, the number of constituents each representative has should be approximately equal.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>We will look at four ways of solving the apportionment problem. Three of them (Lowndes’s method is the exception) 
            have been used at various times to apportion the U.S. Congress, although the method currently in use (the 
            Huntington-Hill method) is significantly more complicated.</p>

        <p>Alexander Hamilton proposed the method that now bears his name. His method was approved by Congress in 1791, but was vetoed by President Washington. It was later adopted in 1852 and used through 1911. He begins by determining, to several decimal places, how many things each group should get. Since he was interested in the question of Congressional representation, we’ll use the language of states and representatives, so he determines how many representatives each state should get.</p>

        <definition><title>Hamilton’s Method</title>
            <p>Hamilton's method follows the steps:</p>
            <p>
            <ol label = "1">
                <li>Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the 
                    total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is 
                    called the <term>divisor</term>.</li>
                <li>Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it 
                    should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the 
                    <term>quota</term>. Since we can only allocate whole representatives, Hamilton resolves the 
                    whole number problem, as follows:</li>
                <li>Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don’t forget what the decimals were). 
                    These are called the <term>lower quotas</term>. Add up the remaining whole numbers. This 
                    answer will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives (and the 
                    “or equal to” part happens only in very specific circumstances that are incredibly unlikely 
                    to turn up).</li>
                <li>Assuming that the total from the previous step was less than the total number of 
                    representatives, assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states whose 
                    decimal parts of the quota were largest, until the desired total is reached.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Make sure that each state ends up with at least one representative!</p>
        </definition>

        <p>Note on rounding: Today we have technological advantages that Hamilton (and the others) couldn’t 
            even have imagined. Take advantage of them, and keep several decimal places.</p>

        <example>
            <p>The state of Delaware has three counties: Kent, New Castle, and Sussex. The Delaware state House 
                of Representatives has 41 members. If Delaware wants to divide this representation along county 
                lines (which is not required, but let’s pretend they do), let’s use Hamilton’s method to 
                apportion them. The populations of the counties are as follows (from the 2010 Census):</p>

                <p>Note that even though Bristol County’s decimal part is greater than .5, it isn’t big enough 
                    to get an additional representative, because three other counties have greater decimal

            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>Hamilton’s method obeys something called the Quota Rule. The Quota Rule isn’t a law of any sort, but 
            just an idea that some people, including Hamilton, think is a good one.</p>

        <definition><title>Quota Rule</title>
            <p>The Quota Rule says that the final number of representatives a state gets should be within one 
                of that state’s quota. Since we’re dealing with whole numbers for our final answers, that means 
                that each state should either go up to the next whole number above its quota, or down to the 
                next whole number below its quota.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>After seeing Hamilton’s method, many people find that it makes sense, it’s not that difficult to use 
            (or, at least, the difficulty comes from the numbers that are involved and the amount of 
            computation that’s needed, not from the method), and they wonder why anyone would want another 
            method. The problem is that Hamilton’s method is subject to several paradoxes. Three of them 
            happened, on separate occasions, when Hamilton’s method was used to apportion the United States 
            House of Representatives.</p>

        <p>The <term>Alabama Paradox</term> is named for an incident that happened during the apportionment 
            that took place after the 1880 census. (A similar incident happened ten years earlier involving the 
            state of Rhode Island, but the paradox is named after Alabama.) The post-1880 apportionment had 
            been completed, using Hamilton’s method and the new population numbers from the census. Then it was 
            decided that because of the country’s growing population, the House of Representatives should be 
            made larger. That meant that the apportionment would need to be done again, still using Hamilton’s 
            method and the same 1880 census numbers, but with more representatives. The assumption was that 
            some states would gain another representative and others would stay with the same number they 
            already had (since there weren’t enough new representatives being added to give one more to every 
            state). The paradox is that Alabama ended up losing a representative in the process, even though no 
            populations were changed and the total number of representatives increased.</p>

        <p>The <term>New States Paradox</term> happened when Oklahoma became a state in 1907. Oklahoma had 
            enough population to qualify for five representatives in Congress. Those five representatives would 
            need to come from somewhere, though, so five states, presumably, would lose one representative 
            each. That happened, but another thing also happened: Maine gained a representative (from New 
            York).</p>

        <p>The <term>Population Paradox</term> happened between the apportionments after the census of 1900 and 
            of 1910. In those ten years, Virginia’s population grew at an average annual rate of 1.07%, while 
            Maine’s grew at an average annual rate of 0.67%. Virginia started with more people, grew at a 
            faster rate, grew by more people, and ended up with more people than Maine. By itself, that doesn’t 
            mean that Virginia should gain representatives or Maine shouldn’t, because there are lots of other 
            states involved. But Virginia ended up losing a representative to Maine.</p>

        <p>Thomas Jefferson proposed a different method for apportionment. After Washington vetoed Hamilton’s 
            method, Jefferson’s method was adopted, and used in Congress from 1791 through 1842. Jefferson, of 
            course, had political reasons for wanting his method to be used rather than Hamilton’s. Primarily, 
            his method favors larger states, and his own home state of Virginia was the largest in the country 
            at the time. He would also argue that it’s the ratio of people to representatives that is the 
            critical thing, and apportionment methods should be based on that. But the paradoxes we saw also 
            provide mathematical reasons for concluding that Hamilton’s method isn’t so good, and while 
            Jefferson’s method might or might not be the best one to replace it, at least we should look for 
            other possibilities.</p>

        <p>The first steps of Jefferson’s method are the same as Hamilton’s method. He finds the same divisor 
            and the same quota, and cuts off the decimal parts in the same way, giving a total number of 
            representatives that is less than the required total. The difference is in how Jefferson resolves 
            that difference. He says that since we ended up with an answer that is too small, our divisor must 
            have been too big. He changes the divisor by making it smaller, finding new quotas with the new 
            divisor, cutting off the decimal parts, and looking at the new total, until we find a divisor that 
            produces the required total.</p>

                <li>Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the

                    called the <term>standard divisor</term>.</li>
                <li>Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it

        <p>Notice, in comparison to Hamilton’s method, that although the results were the same, they came about 
            in a different way, and the outcome was almost different. Providence County (the largest) almost 
            went up to 46 representatives before Kent (which is much smaller) got to 12. Although that didn’t 
            happen here, it can. Divisor-adjusting methods like Jefferson’s are not guaranteed to follow the 
            quota rule!</p>

        <p>Daniel Webster (1782-1852) proposed a method similar to Jefferson’s in 1832. It was adopted by Congress in 1842, 
            but replaced by Hamilton’s method in 1852. It was then adopted again in 1901. The difference is that Webster 
            rounds the quotas to the nearest whole number rather than dropping the decimal parts. If that doesn’t produce 
            the desired results at the beginning, he says, like Jefferson, to adjust the divisor until it does. (In 
            Jefferson’s case, at least the first adjustment will always be to make the divisor smaller. That is not always 
            the case with Webster’s method.)</p>

                <li>Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population 
                    of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the <term>standard 
                    divisor</term>.</li>
                <li>Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. 
                    Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the <term>quota</term>.</li>
                <li>Round all the quotas to the nearest whole number (but don’t forget what the decimals were). Add up the 
                    remaining whole numbers.</li>
                <li>If the total from the previous step was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the 
                    divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from the previous step was larger than 
                    the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. 
                    Continue doing this until the total in the previous step is equal to the total number of 
                    representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the <term>modified divisor</term> or 
                    <term>adjusted divisor</term>.</li>

        <p>Like Jefferson’s method, Webster’s method carries a bias in favor of states with large populations, but rounding 
            the quotas to the nearest whole number greatly reduces this bias. (Notice that Providence County, the largest, 
            is the one that gets a representative trimmed because of the increased quota.) Also like Jefferson’s method, 
            Webster’s method does not always follow the quota rule, but it follows the quota rule much more often than 
            Jefferson’s method does. (In fact, if Webster’s method had been applied to every apportionment of Congress in 
            all of American history, it would have followed the quota rule every single time.)</p>

        <p>In 1980, two mathematicians, Peyton Young and Mike Balinski, proved what we now call the Balinski-Young 
            Impossibility Theorem.</p>

        <definition><title>Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem</title>
            <p>The Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem shows that any apportionment method which always follows the quota 
                rule will be subject to the possibility of paradoxes like the Alabama, New States, or Population paradoxes. 
                In other words, we can choose a method that avoids those paradoxes, but only if we are willing to give up 
                the guarantee of following the quota rule.</p>

        <objectives>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply the Huntington-Hill method to apportionment problems.</li>
            </ul>
        </objectives>
        
        <p>In 1920, no new apportionment was done, because Congress couldn’t agree on the method to be used. They appointed 
            a committee of mathematicians to investigate, and they recommended the Huntington-Hill Method. They continued 
            to use Webster’s method in 1931, but after a second report recommending Huntington-Hill, it was adopted in 1941 
            and is the current method of apportionment used in Congress.</p>

        <p>The Huntington-Hill Method is similar to Webster’s method, but attempts to minimize the percent differences of 
            how many people each representative will represent.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>The population of state A is 5.9 million and they have 7 representatives in Congress.
                State B has a population of 3.8 million and 5 representatives in Congress. Find the average
                constituency of each state. Which state is more poorly represented?</p>
            <solution>
                <p>The average constituency gives the average number of people each member of Congress 
                    represents. We can take the population and divide it by the number of representatives
                    to find the average constituency.</p>
                
                <me>A = \frac{5,900,000}{7}=842,857</me>
                
                <me>B = \frac{3,800,000}{5}=760,000</me>
                
                <p>Since the average constituency in state A is larger than state B, state A is more poorly
                    represented. The representatives in state A represent more people than in state B.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        
    <p>We can discuss how average constituencies are different by computing their absolute difference (this is 
        called the absolute unfairness) or relative difference (this is called the relative unfairness).</p>
        
        <definition>

                State B has a population of 3.8 million and 5 representatives in Congress. Find the absolute 
             and relative unfairness of this apportionment.</p>
            <solution>
                <p>First, find the average constituency of each state.</p>
                
                <me>A = \frac{5,900,000}{7}=842,857</me>
                
                <me>B = \frac{3,800,000}{5}=760,000</me>
                
                <p>The difference in these values is the absolute unfairness. Absolute unfairness should be 
                a positive number, so take the absolute value of the difference if necessary.</p>
                
                <me>\text{AUF}=842,857-760,000 = 82,857</me>
                
                <me>\text{RUF}=\frac{82,847}{760,000}=0.109</me>
                
                <p>The absolute unfairness is <m>82,857</m> people. The relative unfairness is 
                    <m>0.109 = 10.9\%</m>.</p>

                            C lost as bus, that is expected because the number of passengers on A 
                            grew by about 2% (500 people), but the number of passengers on C grew 
                            by less than a 1% (180 people).

            <statement>
                <p>An instructor at a Fitness Center can teach eight classes. A pre-registration 
                    survey indicates the following interest:
                    <ul>
                        <li>66 want to take yoga</li>
                        <li>39 want to take karate</li>
                        <li>18 want to take weight training</li>
                        <li>23 want to take meditation</li>
                    </ul>
                    Assume the instructor will teach at least one class for each area. Use the 
                    Huntington-Hill method to apportion the classes.</p>

        <introduction>Logic is, basically, the study of valid reasoning. When searching the internet, we use Boolean 
            logic - terms like “and” and “or” - to help us find specific web pages that fit in the sets we 
            are interested in. After exploring this form of logic, we will look at logical arguments and
            how we can determine the validity of a claim.</introduction>
        
        <subsection><title>Boolean Logic</title>
        
        <p>We can often classify items as belonging to sets. If you went the library to search for a book 
            and they asked you to express your search using unions, intersections, and complements of 
            sets, that would feel a little strange. Instead, we typically use words like “and”, “or”, and 
            “not” to connect our keywords together to form a search. These words, which form the basis 
            of Boolean logic, are directly related to our set operations. (Boolean logic was developed by 
            the 19th-century English mathematician George Boole.)</p>
        
        <definition><title>Boolean Logic</title>
            <p>Boolean logic combines multiple statements that are either true or false into an 
                expression that is either true or false.</p>
            <p>In connection to sets, a search is true if the element is part of the set.</p>
        </definition>
        
        <p>Suppose M is the set of all mystery books, and C is the set of all comedy books. If we search 
            for “mystery”, we are looking for all the books that are an element of the set M; the search is 
            true for books that are in the set.</p>
            
        <p>When we search for “mystery and comedy”, we are looking for a book that is an element of both sets, 
             in the intersection. If we were to search for “mystery or comedy”, we are looking for a book that is 
             a mystery, a comedy, or both, which is the union of the sets. If we searched for “not comedy”, we are 
             looking for any book in the library that is not a comedy, the complement of the set C.</p>
        
        <note>
            <p>Connection to Set Operations</p>
            
            <p>A and B: elements in the intersection <m>A \cap B</m></p>
            <p>A or B: elements in the union <m>A \cup B</m></p>
            <p>not A: elements in the complement <m>A^C</m></p>
        </note>
        
        <p>Notice here that or is not exclusive. This is a difference between the Boolean logic use of the
            word and common everyday use. When your significant other asks “do you want to go to the
            park or the movies?” they usually are proposing an exclusive choice - one option or the
            other, but not both. In Boolean logic, the or is not exclusive - more like being asked at a
            restaurant “would you like fries or a drink with that?” Answering “both, please” is an
            acceptable answer.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>Suppose we are searching a library database for Mexican universities. Express a reasonable
                search using Boolean logic.</p>
            <solution>We could start with the search “Mexico and university”, but would be likely to find results
                for the U.S. state New Mexico. To account for this, we could revise our search to read:
                Mexico and university not “New Mexico”.</solution>
        </example>
        
        <p>In most internet search engines, it is not necessary to include the word and; the search engine
            assumes that if you provide two keywords you are looking for both. In Google’s search, the
            keyword or has be capitalized as OR, and a negative sign in front of a word is used to
            indicate not. Quotes around a phrase indicate that the entire phrase should be looked for. The
            search from the previous example on Google could be written:
            Mexico university -“New Mexico”.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>Describe the numbers that meet the condition:</p>
            <p>even and less than 10 and greater than 0</p>
            <solution>The numbers that satisfy all three requirements are {2, 4, 6, 8}</solution>
        </example>

       <p>Sometimes statements made in English can be ambiguous. For this reason, Boolean logic
           uses parentheses to show precedent, just like in algebraic order of operations.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>Describe the numbers that meet the condition:</p>
            <p><em>odd number and less than 20 and greater than 0 and (multiple of 3 or multiple of 5)</em></p>
            <solution><p>The first three conditions limit us to the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19}</p>
            <p>The last grouped conditions tell us to find elements of this set that are also either a multiple
                of 3 or a multiple of 5. This leaves us with the set {3, 5, 9, 15}</p>
            <p>Notice that we would have gotten a very different result if we had written</p>
            <p><em>(odd number and less than 20 and greater than 0 and multiple of 3) or multiple of 5</em></p>
            <p>The first grouped set of conditions would give {3, 9, 15}. When combined with the last
                condition, though, this set expands without limits:</p>
                <p>{3, 5, 9, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, …}</p></solution>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>The English phrase “Go to the store and buy me eggs and bagels or cereal” is ambiguous; it
                is not clear whether the requestors is asking for eggs always along with either bagels or
                cereal, or whether they’re asking for either the combination of eggs and bagels, or just cereal.</p>
            <p>For this reason, using parentheses clarifies the intent:</p>
            <p>Eggs and (bagels or cereal) means Option 1: Eggs and bagels, Option 2: Eggs and cereal</p>
            <p>(Eggs and bagels) or cereal means Option 1: Eggs and bagels, Option 2: Cereal</p>
        </example>
        
        <p>Be aware that when a string of conditions is written without grouping symbols, it is often
            interpreted from the left to right, resulting in the latter interpretation.</p>
            
        </subsection>
        
        <subsection><title>Conditional Statements</title>
    
        <p>Beyond searching, Boolean logic is commonly used in spreadsheet applications like Excel to
            do conditional calculations. A statement is something that is either true or false. A statement
            like <m>3  \le 5</m> is true; a statement like “a rat is a fish” is false. A statement like
            <m> x \le 5</m>” is true for some values of x and false for others. When an action is taken or not 
            depending on the value of a statement, it forms a conditional.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Statements and Conditionals</title>
            <p>A <term>statement</term> is either true or false.</p>
            <p>A <term>conditional</term> is a compound statement of the form “if p then q” or “if p then q, else s”.</p>
        </definition>
        
        <example>
            <p>In common language, an example of a conditional statement would be “If it is raining, then
                we’ll go to the mall. Otherwise we’ll go for a hike.”</p>
            <p>The statement “If it is raining” is the condition - this may be true or false for any given day.
                If the condition is true, then we will follow the first course of action, and go to the mall. If
                the condition is false, then we will use the alternative, and go for a hike.</p>
        </example>
        
<!-- Several Examples with Excel are here...maybe add them later**************************************** -->
        
       <example>
           <p>A parent might say to their child “if you clean your room and take out the garbage, then you
               can have ice cream.”</p>
           <p>Here, there are two simpler conditions:
           <ol label = "1">
               <li>The child cleaning her room.</li>
               <li>The child taking out the garbage</li>
               </ol></p>
           
           <p>Since these conditions were joined with and, the combined conditional will be true only if
                both simpler conditions are true; if either chore is not completed, then the parent’s condition
               is not met.</p>
           
           <p>Notice that if the parent had said “if you clean your room or take out the garbage, then you
                can have ice cream”, then the child would need to complete only one chore to meet the
               condition.</p>
        </example>
        
        </subsection>
        
         <subsection><title>Quantified Statements</title>
            <p>Words that describe an entire set, such as “all”, “every”, or “none”, are called universal
            quantifiers because that set could be considered a universal set. In contrast, words or phrases
            such as “some”, “one”, or “at least one” are called existential quantifiers because they
            describe the existence of at least one element in a set.</p>

            <definition><title>Quantifiers</title>
                <p>A <term>universal quantifier</term> states that an entire set of things share a characteristic.</p>
                <p>An <term>existential quantifier</term> states that a set contains at least one element.</p>
            </definition>

            <p>Something interesting happens when we negate - or state the opposite of - a quantified
            statement.</p>

            <example>
                <p>Suppose your friend says “Everybody cheats on their taxes.” What is the minimum amount
                    of evidence you would need to prove your friend wrong?</p>
                <p>To show that it is not true that everybody cheats on their taxes, all you need is one person who does not cheat on their taxes. It would be perfectly fine to produce more people who do not cheat, but one counterexample is all you need.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that you do not need to show that absolutely nobody cheats on their taxes.</p>
            </example>

            <example>
                <p>Suppose your friend says “One of these six cartons of milk is leaking.” What is the minimum amount of evidence you would need to prove your friend wrong?</p>
                <solution>In this case, you would need to check all six cartons and show that none of them is leaking. You cannot disprove your friend’s statement by checking only one of the cartons.</solution>
            </example>

            <p>When we negate a statement with a universal quantifier, we get a statement with an existential quantifier, and vice-versa.</p>

            <note><title>Negating a quantified statement</title>
            <p>The negation of “all A are B” is “at least one A is not B”.</p>
            <p>The negation of “no A are B” is “at least one A is B”.</p>
            <p>The negation of “at least one A is B” is “no A are B”.</p>
            <p>The negation of “at least one A is not B” is “all A are B”</p>
            </note>

            <example>
                <p>“Somebody brought a flashlight.” Write the negation of this statement.</p>
                <solution>The negation is “Nobody brought a flashlight.”</solution>
            </example>

            <example>
                <p>“There are no prime numbers that are even.” Write the negation of this statement.</p>
                <solution>The negation is “At least one prime number is even.</solution>
            </example>

            <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                <p>Write the negation of “All Icelandic children learn English in school.”</p>
                <answer>At least one Icelandic child did not learn English in school. </answer>
            </problem>
        </subsection>
        
        <subsection><title>Statements in Symbolic Form.</title>
        
            <p>Before we focus on truth tables, we’re going to introduce some symbols that are commonly
        used for and, or, and not.</p>

    <note><title>Symbols</title>
        <p>Some of the symbols that are used for and, or, and not are:</p>
        <p>The symbol <m>\wedge</m> is used for <em>and</em>: A and B is notated <m>A \wedge B</m></p>
        <p>The symbol <m>\vee</m> is used for <em>or</em>: A or B is notated <m>A \vee B</m></p>
        <p>The symbol <m>\sim</m> is used for <em>not</em>: not A is notated <m>\sim A</m></p>
    </note>
        
         <p>You can remember the first two symbols by relating them to the shapes for the union and
        intersection. <m>A \wedge B</m> would be the elements that exist in both sets, in <m>A \cap B</m>. Likewise, <m>A \vee B</m>
        would be the elements that exist in either set, in <m>A \cup B</m>. When we are working with sets, we
        use the rounded version of the symbols; when we are working with statements, we use the
        pointy version.</p>


    <example>
    <p>Translate each statement into symbolic notation. Let P represent “I like Pepsi” and let C
    represent “I like Coke”.</p>
        <p>
    <ol label = "a">
        <li>I like Pepsi or I like Coke.
            </li>
        <li>I like Pepsi and I like Coke.
            </li>
        <li>I do not like Pepsi.
            </li>
        <li>It is not the case that I like Pepsi or Coke.
            </li>
        <li>I like Pepsi and I do not like Coke.
            </li>
            </ol></p>
        
        <solution>
            <p>
                <ol label = "a">
                    <li><m>P \vee C</m></li>
                    <li><m>P \wedge C</m></li>
                    <li><m>\sim P</m></li>
                    <li><m>\sim \left( P \vee C \right)</m></li>
                    <li><m>P \wedge \sim C</m></li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
           <p>As you can see, we can use parentheses to organize more complicated statements.</p>  
            
        </solution>
                
        
    </example>

    <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
    <p>Translate “We have carrots or we will not make soup” into symbols. Let C represent “we
    have carrots” and let S represent “we will make soup”.</p>

        <subsection><title>Truth Tables: Conjuction (and), Disjunction (or), Negation (not)</title>

    <p>Because complex Boolean statements can get tricky to think about, we can create a truth
    table to keep track of what truth values for the simple statements make the complex
    statement true and false.</p>

    <definition><title>Truth Tables</title>
        <p>A table showing what the resulting truth value of a complex statement is for all the
        possible truth values for the simple statements.</p>
    </definition>

    <example>
        <p>Suppose you’re picking out a new couch, and your significant other says “get a sectional or
        something with a chaise”.</p>
        
        <p>This is a complex statement made of two simpler conditions: “is a sectional”, and “has a
        chaise”. For simplicity, let’s use S to designate “is a sectional”, and C to designate “has a
        chaise”.</p>
        
        <p>A truth table for this situation would look like this:</p>
        
        <table >
            <title>Truth Table</title >
                <tabular halign = "center">
                    <row header = "yes" bottom = "minor" >
                        <cell><m>S</m> </cell>
                        <cell right="minor"><m>C</m> </cell>
                        <cell><m>S \vee C</m> </cell>
                    </row>
                   <row>
                        <cell>T</cell>
                        <cell right="minor">T</cell>
                        <cell>T</cell>
                    </row>
                    <row>
                        <cell>T</cell>
                        <cell right="minor">F</cell>
                        <cell>T</cell>
                    </row>
                    <row>
                        <cell>F</cell>
                        <cell right="minor">T</cell>
                        <cell>T</cell>
                    </row>
                    <row>
                        <cell>F</cell>
                        <cell right="minor">F</cell>
                        <cell>F</cell>
                    </row>
            </tabular>
        </table >
        
        <p>In the table, T is used for true, and F for false. In the first row, if S is true and C is also true,
        then the complex statement “S or C” is true. This would be a sectional that also has a chaise,
        which meets our desire. (Remember that or in logic is not exclusive; if the couch has both

                <p>The truth table shows that <m>A \vee \sim B</m> is true in three cases and false in one case. If you’re
        wondering what the point of this is, suppose it is the last day of the baseball season and two
        teams, who are not playing each other, are competing for the final playoff spot. Anaheim will
        make the playoffs if it wins its game or if Boston does not win its game. (Anaheim owns the
        tie-breaker; if both teams win, or if both teams lose, then Anaheim gets the playoff spot.) If A
                    = Anaheim wins its game and B = Boston wins its game, then <m>A \vee \sim B</m> represents the situation
        “Anaheim wins its game or Boston does not win its game”. The truth table shows us the
        different scenarios related to Anaheim making the playoffs. In the first row, Anaheim wins
        its game and Boston wins its game, so it is true that Anaheim makes the playoffs. In the
        second row, Anaheim wins and Boston does not win, so it is true that Anaheim makes the
        playoffs. In the third row, Anaheim does not win its game and Boston wins its game, so it is
        false that Anaheim makes the playoffs. In the fourth row, Anaheim does not win and Boston
            does not win, so it is true that Anaheim makes the playoffs.</p>

        <subsection><title>De Morgan's Laws</title>
            
        <p>A contemporary of Boole’s, Augustus De Morgan, formalized two rules of logic that had
        previously been known informally. They allow us to rewrite the negation of a conjunction as
            a disjunction, and vice-versa.</p>
            
        <p>For example, suppose you want to schedule a meeting with two colleagues at 4:30PM on
        Friday, and you need both of them to be available at that time. What situation would make it
        impossible to have the meeting? It is NOT the case that colleague a is available AND
            colleague b is available: <m>\sim \left(a \wedge b\right)</m>. This situation is equivalent to either colleague a NOT
            being available OR colleague b NOT being available: <m>\sim a \vee \sim b</m>.</p>
            
            <definition><title>De Morgan's Laws</title>
                <p>The negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of the
                    statements making up the conjunction. To negate an "and" statement, negate each part
                    and change the "and" to "or".</p>
                <p><m>\sim \left(p \wedge q \right)</m> is equivalent to <m>\sim p \vee \sim q</m></p>

                <answer>Failing to meet just one of the three conditions is all it takes to be disqualified. A person is
                    disqualified if they were not born in the US, or are not at least 35 years old, or have not
                    lived in the US for at least 14 years. The key word here is “or” instead of “and”. </answer>

        <introduction>
                    <p>We discussed conditional statements earlier, in which we take an action based on the value of
                the condition. We are now going to look at another version of a conditional, sometimes
                called an implication, which states that the second part must logically follow from the first.</p>
        </introduction>
        
        <subsection><title>Truth Tables: Conditional Statements</title>
            
            <note><title>Conditional</title>
                <p>A conditional is a logical compound statement in which a statement p, called the
                    antecedent, implies a statement q, called the consequent.</p>
                <p>A conditional is written as <m>p \to q</m> and is translated as “if p, then q”.</p>
                
            </note>
            
             <example>
            <p>The English statement “If it is raining, then there are clouds is the sky” is a conditional
            statement. It makes sense because if the antecedent “it is raining” is true, then the consequent
            “there are clouds in the sky” must also be true.</p>

            </example>

            <p>Notice that the statement tells us nothing of what to expect if it is not raining; there might be
            clouds in the sky, or there might not. If the antecedent is false, then the consquent becomes
            irrelevant.</p>

            <example>
   
                <p>Suppose you order a team jersey online on Tuesday and want to receive it by Friday so you
                can wear it to Saturday’s game. The website says that if you pay for expedited shipping, you
                will receive the jersey by Friday. In what situation is the website telling a lie?</p>
                <p>There are four possible outcomes:
                <ol label ="1">
                    <li>You pay for expedited shipping and receive the jersey by Friday</li>
                    <li>You pay for expedited shipping and don’t receive the jersey by Friday</li>
                    <li>You don’t pay for expedited shipping and receive the jersey by Friday</li>
                    <li>You don’t pay for expedited shipping and don’t receive the jersey by Friday</li>
                </ol></p>

                <p>Only one of these outcomes proves that the website was lying: the second outcome in which
                    you pay for expedited shipping but don’t receive the jersey by Friday. The first outcome is
                    exactly what was promised, so there’s no problem with that. The third outcome is not a lie
                    because the website never said what would happen if you didn’t pay for expedited shipping;
                    maybe the jersey would arrive by Friday whether you paid for expedited shipping or not. The
                    fourth outcome is not a lie because, again, the website didn’t make any promises about when
                    the jersey would arrive if you didn’t pay for expedited shipping.</p>

            </example>
            
            <example>
                <p>A friend tells you “If you upload that picture to Facebook, you’ll lose your job.” Under what 
                    conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?</p>
                
                <p>There are four possible outcomes:
                <ol label = "1">
                    <li>You upload the picture and lose your job</li>
                    <li>You upload the picture and don’t lose your job</li>
                    <li>You don’t upload the picture and lose your job</li>
                    <li>You don’t upload the picture and don’t lose your job</li>
                </ol></p>
                
                <p>There is only one possible case in which you can say your friend was wrong: the second
                outcome in which you upload the picture but still keep your job. In the last two cases, your
                friend didn’t say anything about what would happen if you didn’t upload the picture, so you
                can’t say that their statement was wrong. Even if you didn’t upload the picture and lost your
                job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn’t
                    upload the picture; you might lose your job for missing a shift or punching your boss instead.</p>
                
            </example>
            
            <p>In traditional logic, a conditional is considered true as long as there are no cases in which the
                antecedent is true and the consequent is false.</p>

                <p>Consider again the conditional “If it is raining, then there are clouds in the sky.” It seems
                    reasonable to assume that this is true.</p>
                <p>The converse would be “If there are clouds in the sky, then it is raining.” This is not always
                    true.</p>
                <p>The inverse would be “If it is not raining, then there are not clouds in the sky.” Likewise, this
                    is not always true.</p>
                <p>The contrapositive would be “If there are not clouds in the sky, then it is not raining.” This
                    statement is true, and is equivalent to the original conditional.</p>
            </example>
            
            <p>Looking at truth tables, we can see that the original conditional and the contrapositive are

<note><title>Equivalence</title>
                <p>A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.
                    The converse and inverse of a conditional statement are logically equivalent.</p>
            </note>
            
            <p>In other words, the original statement and the contrapositive must agree with each other; they
                must both be true, or they must both be false. Similarly, the converse and the inverse must
                agree with each other; they must both be true, or they must both be false.</p>
            
            <p>Be aware that symbolic logic cannot represent the English language perfectly. For example,
                we may need to change the verb tense to show that one thing occurred before another.</p>
            
            <example>
                <p>Suppose this statement is true: “If I eat this giant cookie, then I will feel sick.” Which of the
                    following statements must also be true?</p>
                <p>
                <ol label = "a">
                    <li>If I feel sick, then I ate that giant cookie.</li>
                    <li>If I don’t eat this giant cookie, then I won’t feel sick.</li>
                    <li>If I don’t feel sick, then I didn’t eat that giant cookie.</li>
                </ol></p>
                
                <solution>
                    <p>
                <ol label = "a">
                    <li>This is the converse, which is not necessarily true. I could feel sick for some other reason,
                        such as drinking sour milk.</li>
                    <li>This is the inverse, which is not necessarily true. Again, I could feel sick for some other
                        reason; avoiding the cookie doesn’t guarantee that I won’t feel sick.</li>
                    <li>This is the contrapositive, which is true, but we have to think somewhat backwards to
                    explain it. If I ate the cookie, I would feel sick, but since I don’t feel sick, I must not have
                        eaten the cookie.</li>
                </ol></p>
                
                <p>Notice again that the original statement and the contrapositive have the same truth value
                    (both are true), and the converse and the inverse have the same truth value (both are false).</p>

            <p>Consider the statement “If you park here, then you will get a ticket.” What set of conditions
                would prove this statement false?
            
            <ol label = "a">
                <li>You don’t park here and you get a ticket.</li>

                <li>You park here and you don’t get a ticket.</li>
                
            </ol></p>
            
            <p>The first two statements are irrelevant because we don’t know what will happen if you park
        somewhere else. The third statement, however contradicts the conditional statement “If you
        park here, then you will get a ticket” because you parked here but didn’t get a ticket. This
        example demonstrates a general rule; the negation of a conditional can be written as a
        conjunction: “It is not the case that if you park here, then you will get a ticket” is equivalent
                to “You park here and you do not get a ticket.”</p>

        <subsection><title>Biconditional Statements</title>
            
            <p>In everyday life, we often have a stronger meaning in mind when we use a conditional
            statement. Consider “If you submit your hours today, then you will be paid next Friday.”
            What the payroll rep really means is “If you submit your hours today, then you will be paid
            next Friday, and if you don’t submit your hours today, then you won’t be paid next Friday.”
            The conditional statement if t, then p also includes the inverse of the statement: if not t, then
            not p. A more compact way to express this statement is “You will be paid next Friday if and
            only if you submit your timesheet today.” A statement of this form is called a <term>biconditional</term>.</p>
            
            <note><title>Biconditional</title>
                <p>A biconditional is a logical conditional statement in which the antecedent and
                    consequent are interchangeable.</p>
                <p>A biconditional is written as <m>p \leftrightarrow q</m> and is translated as “p if and only if q”.</p>
            </note>
            
            <p>Because a biconditional statement <m>p \leftrightarrow q</m> is equivalent to <m>\left(p \to q \right) 
                \wedge \left(q \to p\right)</m>, we may think
            of it as a conditional statement combined with its converse: if p, then q and if q, then p. The
            double-headed arrow shows that the conditional statement goes from left to right and from
            right to left. A biconditional is considered true as long as the antecedent and the consequent
                have the same truth value; that is, they are either both true or both false.</p>

       <introduction>A logical argument is a claim that a set of premises support a conclusion. This section will define the different 
           arguments types and discuss how truth tables can be used 
           to determine whether an arugment is valid or invalid.</introduction>
        
        <subsection><title>Argument Types</title>
        
            <p>There are two general types of arguments:</p>
            <p>An <term>inductive argument</term> uses a collection of specific examples as its premises and uses
                them to propose a general conclusion.</p>
            <p>A <term>deductive argument</term> uses a collection of general statements as its premises and uses
                them to propose a specific situation as the conclusion.</p>

        
        <example>
            <p>The argument “when I went to the store last week I forgot my purse, and when I went today I
                forgot my purse. I always forget my purse when I go the store” is an inductive argument.</p>
            <p>The premises are:
            <ul>
                <li>I forgot my purse last week</li>
                <li>I forgot my purse today</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>The conclusion is:
            <ul>
                <li>I always forget my purse</li>
            </ul></p>
            
            <p>Notice that the premises are specific situations, while the conclusion is a general statement.
                In this case, this is a fairly weak argument, since it is based on only two instances.</p>
            
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>The argument “every day for the past year, a plane flies over my house at 2:00 P.M. A plane
                will fly over my house every day at 2:00 P.M.” is a stronger inductive argument, since it is
                based on a larger set of evidence. While it is not necessarily true—the airline may have
                cancelled its afternoon flight—it is probably a safe bet.</p>
        </example>
        
        <note>
            <title>Evaluating inductive arguments</title>
            <p>An inductive argument is never able to prove the conclusion true, but it can provide
                either weak or strong evidence to suggest that it may be true.</p>
        </note>
        
        <p>Many scientific theories, such as the big bang theory, can never be proven. Instead, they are
        inductive arguments supported by a wide variety of evidence. Usually in science, an idea is
        considered a hypothesis until it has been well tested, at which point it graduates to being
        considered a theory. Common scientific theories, like Newton’s theory of gravity, have all
        stood up to years of testing and evidence, though sometimes they need to be adjusted based
            on new evidence, such as when Einstein proposed the theory of general relativity</p>
        
        <p>A deductive argument is more clearly valid or not, which makes it easier to evaluate.</p>
        
        <note><title>Evaluating deductive arguments</title>
            <p>A deductive argument is considered valid if, assuming that all the premises are true, the
                conclusion follows logically from those premises. In other words, when the premises
                are all true, the conclusion must be true. </p>

        <subsection><title>Evaluating Dedutive Arguments with Truth Tables</title>
            
            <p>Arguments can also be analyzed using truth tables, although this can be a lot of work.</p>

            <p>To analyze an argument with a truth table:</p>
            <p>
            <ol label = "1">
                <li>Represent each of the premises and the conclusion symbolically</li>
                <li>Create truth tables for each premise and for the conclusion.</li>
                <li>The argument is valid if and only if the conclusion is true when all premises are true.</li>
            </ol></p>
            
            <example>
                <p>Consider the argument</p>
                <p>Premise: If you bought bread, then you went to the store.</p>
                <p>Premise: You bought bread.</p>
                <p>Conclusion: You went to the store.</p>
                <p>While this example is fairly obviously a valid argument, we can analyze it by representing the argument symbolically 
                and then creating truth tables for the premises and conclusion.</p>
                <p>We’ll let b represent “you bought bread” and s represent “you went to the store”. Then the
                argument becomes:</p>
                <p>Premise: <m>b \to s</m></p>
                <p>Premise: <m>b</m></p>
                <p>Conclusion: <m>s</m></p>

            </problem>
            
        </subsection>
        
       <subsection><title>Forms of Arguments</title>
        
<p>Rather than making a truth table for every argument, we may be able to recognize certain
common forms of arguments that are valid (or invalid). If we can determine that an argument
fits one of the common forms, we can immediately state whether it is valid or invalid.</p>

<definition><title>Law of Detachment</title>
<p>The law of detachment applies when a conditional and its antecedent are given as
premises, and the consequent is the conclusion. </p>
<p>The general form is:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>p \to q</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>p</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>q</m></p>
</definition>

<example>
    <p>Recall this argument from an earlier example:</p>
    <p>Premise: If you bought bread, then you went to the store.</p>
    <p>Premise: You bought bread.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: You went to the store.</p>

    <p>In symbolic form:</p>
    <p>Premise: <m>b \to s</m></p>
    <p>Premise: <m>b</m></p>
    <p>Conclusion: <m>s</m></p>
    <p>This argument has the structure described by the law of detachment. (The second premise
    and the conclusion are simply the two parts of the first premise detached from each other.)
    Instead of making a truth table, we can say that this argument is valid by stating that it
    satisfies the law of detachment.</p>

</example>

<definition><title>Law of Contraposition</title>
<p>The law of contraposition applies when a conditional and the negation of its
consequent are given as premises, and the negation of its antecedent is the conclusion.</p>
<p>The general form is:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>p \to q</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>\sim q</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>\sim p</m></p>
</definition>

<p>Notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the contrapositive of the first
premise, <m>\sim q \to \sim p</m>, but they have been detached. You can think of the law of contraposition
as a combination of the law of detachment and the fact that the contrapositive is logically
equivalent to the original statement.</p>

<example>
    <p>Premise: If I drop my phone into the swimming pool, my phone will be ruined.</p>
    <p>Premise: My phone isn’t ruined.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: I didn’t drop my phone into the swimming pool.</p>
<p>If we let d = I drop the phone in the pool and r = the phone is ruined, then we can represent
the argument this way:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>d \to r</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>\sim r</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>\sim d</m></p>
<p>The form of this argument matches what we need to invoke the law of contraposition, so it is
a valid argument.</p>
</example>

<problem><title>Try It Now</title>
    <p>Is this argument valid?</p>
<p>Premise: If you brushed your teeth before bed, then your toothbrush will be wet.</p>
<p>Premise: Your toothbrush is dry.</p>
<p>Conclusion: You didn’t brush your teeth before bed.</p>

<answer>Yes, by the Law of Contraposition</answer>
</problem>

<definition><title>The Transitive Property</title>

<p>The transitive property has as its premises a series of conditionals, where the
consequent of one is the antecedent of the next. The conclusion is a conditional with
the same antecedent as the first premise and the same consequent as the final premise.</p>
<p>The general form is:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>p \to q</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>q \to r</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>p \to r</m></p>

</definition>

<example>
    <p>Premise: If a soccer player commits a reckless foul, she will receive a yellow card.</p>
<p>Premise: If Hayley receives a yellow card, she will be suspended for the next match.</p>
<p>Conclusion: If Hayley commits a reckless foul, she will be suspended for the next match.</p>
<p>If we let r = committing a reckless foul, y = receiving a yellow card, and s = being
suspended, then our argument looks like this:</p>
<p>Premise <m>r \to y</m></p>
<p>Premise <m>y \to s</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>r \to s</m></p>
<p>This argument has the exact structure required to use the transitive property, so it is a valid
argument.</p>
</example>

<definition><title>Disjunctive Syllogism</title>
<p>In a disjunctive syllogism, the premises consist of an or statement and the negation of
one of the options. The conclusion is the other option. </p>
<p>The general form is:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>p \vee q</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>\sim p</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>q</m>
</p>
</definition>

<p>The order of the two parts of the disjunction isn’t important. In other words, we could have
the premises <m>p \vee q</m> and <m>\sim q</m>, and the conclusion <m>p</m>.</p>

<example>
    <p>Premise: I can either drive or take the train.</p>
<p>Premise: I refuse to drive.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I will take the train.</p>
<p>If we let d = I drive and t = I take the train, then the symbolic representation of the argument
is:</p>
<p>Premise <m>d \vee t</m></p>
<p>Premise <m>\sim d</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>t</m></p>
<p>This argument is valid because it has the form of a disjunctive syllogism. I have two choices,
and one of them is not going to happen, so the other one must happen.</p>
            
</example>

<p>Keep in mind that, when you are determining the validity of an argument, you must assume
that the premises are true. If you don’t agree with one of the premises, you need to keep your
personal opinion out of it. Your job is to pretend that the premises are true and then
determine whether they force you to accept the conclusion. You may attack the premises in a
court of law or a political discussion, of course, but here we are focusing on the structure of
the arguments, not the truth of what they actually say.</p>

<p>We have just looked at four forms of valid arguments; there are two common forms that
represent invalid arguments, which are also called <em>fallacies</em>.</p>

<definition><title>Fallacy of the Converse</title>
<p>The fallacy of the converse arises when a conditional and its consequent are given as
premises, and the antecedent is the conclusion.</p>
<p>The general form is:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>p \to q</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>q</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>p</m></p>
</definition>

<p>Notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the converse of the first premise,
<m>q \to p</m>, but they have been detached. The fallacy of the converse incorrectly tries to assert
that the converse of a statement is equivalent to that statement.</p>

<example>
    <p>Premise: If I drink coffee after noon, then I have a hard time falling asleep that night.</p>
<p>Premise: I had a hard time falling asleep last night.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I drank coffee after noon yesterday.</p>
<p>If we let c = I drink coffee after noon and h = I have a hard time falling asleep, then our
argument looks like this:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>c \to h</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>h</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>c</m></p>
<p>This argument uses converse reasoning, so it is an invalid argument. There could be plenty of
other reasons why I couldn’t fall asleep: I could be worried about money, my neighbors
might have been setting off fireworks, etc. </p>

</example>

<definition><title>Fallacy of the Inverse</title>
<p>The fallacy of the inverse occurs when a conditional and the negation of its antecedent
are given as premises, and the negation of the consequent is the conclusion. </p>
<p>The general form is:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>p \to q</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>\sim p</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>\sim q</m></p>
</definition>

<p>Again, notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the inverse of the first
premise, <m>\sim p \to \sim q</m>, but they have been detached. The fallacy of the inverse incorrectly tries to
assert that the inverse of a statement is equivalent to that statement.</p>

<example>
    <p>Premise: If you listen to the Grateful Dead, then you are a hippie.</p>
<p>Premise: Sky doesn’t listen to the Grateful Dead.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Sky is not a hippie.</p>
<p>If we let g = listen to the Grateful Dead and h = is a hippie, then this is the argument:</p>
<p>Premise: <m>g \to h</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m> \sim g</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>\sim h</m></p>
<p>This argument is invalid because it uses inverse reasoning. The first premise does not imply
that all hippies listen to the Grateful Dead; there could be some hippies who listen to Phish
instead.</p>
</example>

<p>Of course, arguments are not limited to these six basic forms; some arguments have more
premises, or premises that need to be rearranged before you can see what is really happening.
There are plenty of other forms of arguments that are invalid. If an argument doesn’t seem to
fit the pattern of any of these common forms, though, you may want to use a Venn diagram
or a truth table instead.</p>

<p>Lewis Carroll, author of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, was a math and logic teacher,
and wrote two books on logic. In them, he would propose premises as a puzzle, to be
connected using syllogisms. The following example is one such puzzle.</p>

<example>
    <p>Solve the puzzle. In other words, find a logical conclusion from these premises.</p>
<p>All babies are illogical.</p>
<p>Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.</p>
<p>Illogical persons are despised.</p>
<p>Let b = is a baby, d = is despised, i = is illogical, and m = can manage a crocodile.
Then we can write the premises as:</p>
<p><m>b \to i</m></p>
<p><m>m \to \sim d</m></p>
<p><m>i \to d</m></p>
<p>Writing the second premise correctly can be a challenge; it can be rephrased as “If you can
manage a crocodile, then you are not despised.”</p>
<p>Using the transitive property with the first and third premises, we can conclude that <m>b \to d</m>;
that all babies are despised. Using the contrapositive of the second premise, <m>d \to \sim m</m>, we can
then use the transitive property with <m>b \to d</m> to conclude that <m>b \to \sim m</m>; that babies cannot
manage crocodiles. While it is silly, this is a logical conclusion from the given premises.</p>

</example>

<problem><title>Try It Now</title>
    <p>Is this argument valid?</p>
<p>Premise: If I go to the party, I’ll be really tired tomorrow.</p>
<p>Premise: If I go to the party, I’ll get to see friends.</p>
<p>Conclusion: If I don’t see friends, I won’t be tired tomorrow</p>

<answer>
    <p>Let p = go to party, t = be tired, and f = see friends.</p>
<p>Premise: <m>p \to t</m></p>
<p>Premise: <m>p \to f</m></p>
<p>Conclusion: <m>\sim f \to \sim t</m></p>
<p>We could try to rewrite the second premise using the contrapositive to state <m>\sim f \to \sim p</m>, but
that does not allow us to form a syllogism. If I don’t see friends, then I didn’t go the party,
but that is not sufficient to claim I won’t be tired tomorrow. Maybe I stayed up all night
watching movies.</p>
</answer>
</problem>

</subsection>

<subsection><title>Logical Fallacies in Common Language</title>
<p>In the previous discussion, we saw that logical arguments can be invalid when the premises
are not true, when the premises are not sufficient to guarantee the conclusion, or when there
are invalid chains in logic. There are a number of other ways in which arguments can be
invalid, a sampling of which are given here.</p>

<definition><title>Ad hominem</title>
<p>An ad hominem argument attacks the person making the argument, ignoring the
argument itself.</p>
</definition>

<example>
    <p>“Jane says that whales aren’t fish, but she’s only in the second grade, so she can’t be right.”</p>
<p>Here the argument is attacking Jane, not the validity of her claim, so this is an ad hominem
argument.</p>

</example>

<example>
    <p>“Jane says that whales aren’t fish, but everyone knows that they’re really mammals. She’s so
stupid.”</p>
<p>This certainly isn’t very nice, but it is not ad hominem since a valid counterargument is made
along with the personal insult.</p>

</example>

<definition><titl>Appeal to ignorance</titl>
<p>This type of argument assumes something it true because it hasn’t been proven false</p>
</definition>

<example>
    <p>“Nobody has proven that photo isn’t of Bigfoot, so it must be Bigfoot.”</p>

</example>

<definition><title>Appeal to authority</title>
<p>These arguments attempt to use the authority of a person to prove a claim. While often
authority can provide strength to an argument, problems can occur when the person’s
opinion is not shared by other experts, or when the authority is irrelevant to the claim.</p>
</definition>

<example>
    <p>“A diet high in bacon can be healthy; Doctor Atkins said so.”</p>
<p>Here, an appeal to the authority of a doctor is used for the argument. This generally would
provide strength to the argument, except that the opinion that eating a diet high in saturated
fat runs counter to general medical opinion. More supporting evidence would be needed to
justify this claim.</p>
</example>

<example>
    <p>“Jennifer Hudson lost weight with Weight Watchers, so their program must work.”</p>
<p>Here, there is an appeal to the authority of a celebrity. While her experience does provide
evidence, it provides no more than any other person’s experience would.</p>
</example>

<definition><title>Appeal to consequence</title>
<p>An appeal to consequence concludes that a premise is true or false based on whether
the consequences are desirable or not.</p>
</definition>

<example>
<p>“Humans will travel faster than light: faster-than-light travel would be beneficial for space
travel.”</p>
</example>

<definition><title>False dilemma</title>
<p>A false dilemma argument falsely frames an argument as an “either or” choice, without
allowing for additional options.</p>
</definition>

<example>
<p>“Either those lights in the sky were an airplane or aliens. There are no airplanes scheduled for
tonight, so it must be aliens.”</p>
<p>This argument ignores the possibility that the lights could be something other than an
airplane or aliens.</p>
</example>

<definition><title>Circular reasoning</title>
<p>Circular reasoning is an argument that relies on the conclusion being true for the
premise to be true.</p>
</definition>

<example>
    <p>“I shouldn’t have gotten a C in that class; I’m an A student!”</p>
<p>In this argument, the student is claiming that because they’re an A student, though shouldn’t
have gotten a C. But because they got a C, they’re not an A student.</p>
</example>

<definition><title>Post hoc (post hoc ergo propter hoc)</title>
<p>A post hoc argument claims that because two things happened sequentially, then the
first must have caused the second.</p>
</definition>

<example>
<p>“Today I wore a red shirt, and my football team won! I need to wear a red shirt every time
they play to make sure they keep winning.”</p></example>

<definition><title>Straw man</title>
A straw man argument involves misrepresenting the argument in a less favorable way
to make it easier to attack.</definition>

<example>
<p>“Senator Jones has proposed reducing military funding by 10%. Apparently he wants to leave
us defenseless against attacks by terrorists”</p>
<p>Here the arguer has represented a 10% funding cut as equivalent to leaving us defenseless,
making it easier to attack Senator Jones’ position.</p>
</example>

<definition><title>Correlation implies causation</title>
<p>Similar to post hoc, but without the requirement of sequence, this fallacy assumes that
just because two things are related one must have caused the other. Often there is a
third variable not considered.</p></definition>

<example>
<p>“Months with high ice cream sales also have a high rate of deaths by drowning. Therefore,
ice cream must be causing people to drown.”</p>
<p>This argument is implying a causal relation, when really both are more likely dependent on
the weather; that ice cream and drowning are both more likely during warm summer months.</p>
</example>

<problem><title>Try It Now</title>
    <p>Identify the logical fallacy in each of the arguments</p>
    <p>
    <ol label = "a">
        <li>Only an untrustworthy person would run for office. The fact that politicians are
untrustworthy is proof of this.</li>
<li>Since the 1950s, both the atmospheric carbon dioxide level and obesity levels have
increased sharply. Hence, atmospheric carbon dioxide causes obesity.</li>
        <li>The oven was working fine until you started using it, so you must have broken it.</li>
<li>You can’t give me a D in the class because I can’t afford to retake it.</li>
<li>The senator wants to increase support for food stamps. He wants to take the taxpayers’
hard-earned money and give it away to lazy people. This isn’t fair, so we shouldn’t do it. </li>
</ol></p>
    
    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol label = "a">
                <li>Circular</li>
                <li>Correlation does not imply causation</li>
                <li>Post hoc</li>
                <li>Appeal to consequence</li>
                <li>Staw man</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </answer>
</problem>

<p>It may be difficult to identify one particular fallacy for an argument. Consider this argument:
“Emma Watson says she’s a feminist, but she posed for these racy pictures. I’m a feminist,
and no self-respecting feminist would do that.” Could this be ad hominem, saying that Emma
Watson has no self-respect? Could it be appealing to authority because the person making the
argument claims to be a feminist? Could it be a false dilemma because the argument assumes
that a woman is either a feminist or not, with no gray area in between?</p>

                    <p>We can write the statements in symbolic form as:

                    </p>
                    <p>Since the conditional and contrapositive are logically equivalent, statements a and d are 
                        equivalent. The converse and the inverse are equivalent to each other, so b and c are 
                        logically equivalent.</p>

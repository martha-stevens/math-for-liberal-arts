<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<div class="para">There are a lot of ways there could be at least one shared birthday. Fortunately there is an easier way. We ask ourselves “What is the alternative to having at least one shared birthday?” In this case, the alternative is that there are no shared birthdays. In other words, the alternative to “at least one” is having none. In other words, since this is a complementary event,</div> <div class="para">P(at least one)=1-P(none)</div> <div class="para">We will start, then, by computing the probability that there is no shared birthday. Let's imagine that you are one of these three people. Your birthday can be anything without conflict, so there are 365 choices out of 365 for your birthday. What is the probability that the second person does not share your birthday? There are 365 days in the year (let's ignore leap years) and removing your birthday from contention, there are 364 choices that will guarantee that you do not share a birthday with this person, so the probability that the second person does not share your birthday is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{364}{365}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Now we move to the third person. What is the probability that this third person does not have the same birthday as either you or the second person? There are 363 days that will not duplicate your birthday or the second person's, so the probability that the third person does not share a birthday with the first two is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{363}{365}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We want the second person not to share a birthday with you and the third person not to share a birthday with the first two people, so we use the multiplication rule:</div> <div class="para">P(no shared birthday)=<span class="process-math">\(\frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \cdot \frac{363}{365} \approx 
0.9918\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">and then subtract from 1 to get</div> <div class="para">P(shared birthday)= 1 - P(no shared birthday)=<span class="process-math">\(1-0.9918=0.0082\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">This is a pretty small number, so maybe it makes sense that the answer to our original problem will be small. Let's make our group a bit bigger.</div>

    <title>Voting Theory</title>
    <introduction><p>In many decision making situations, it is necessary to gather the group consensus. This happens when 
        a group of friends decides which movie to watch, when a company decides which product design to manufacture, and 
        when a democratic country elects its leaders.</p>

        <p>While the basic idea of voting is fairly universal, the method by which those votes are used to determine a 
            winner can vary. Amongst a group of friends, you may decide upon a movie by voting for all the movies you’re 
            willing to watch, with the winner being the one with the greatest approval. A company might eliminate 
            unpopular designs then revote on the remaining. A country might look for the candidate with the most 
            votes.</p>

        <p>In deciding upon a winner, there is always one main goal: to reflect the preferences of the people in the most 
            fair way possible.</p>

        <p>To begin, we’re going to want more information than a traditional ballot normally provides.  
            A traditional ballot usually asks you to pick your favorite from a list of choices.  This ballot 
            fails to provide any information on how a voter would rank the alternatives if their first choice was 
            unsuccessful. </p>
        
        <definition><title>Preference Ballot</title>
            <p>A <term>preference ballot</term> is a ballot in which the voter ranks the choices in order of preference.

        <definition><title>Plurality Method</title>
            <p>In this method, the choice with the most first-preference votes is declared the winner. Ties are possible, 
                and would have to be settled through some sort of run-off vote.</p>
         </definition>

        <p>This method is sometimes mistakenly called the majority method, or “majority rules”, but it is not necessary for 
            a choice to have gained a majority of votes to win. A majority is over 50%; it is possible for a winner to have 
            a plurality without having a majority.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>For the plurality method, we only care about the first choice options. Totaling them up:</p>
                <p>Anaheim: <m>1+3 = 4</m> first-choice votes</p>
                <p>Orlando: <m>3</m> first-choice votes</p>
                <p>Hawaii: <m>3</m> first-choice votes</p>

                <p>Anaheim is the winner using the plurality voting method.</p>

                <p>Notice that Anaheim won with 4 out of 10 votes, 40% of the votes, which is a plurality of the votes, but

            <p>This doesn’t seem right, does it? Anaheim just won the election, yet 6 out of 10 voters, 60% of them, would 
                have preferred Hawaii! That hardly seems fair. Marquis de Condorcet, a French philosopher, mathematician, 
                and political scientist wrote about how this could happen in 1785, and for him we name our first fairness 
                criterion.</p>

            <definition><title>Condorcet Criterion</title>
                <p>If there is a choice that is preferred in every one-to-one comparison with the other choices, that choice 
                    should be the winner. We call this winner the Condorcet Winner, or <term>Condorcet Candidate</term>.</p>

            <example>
                <p>In the election in <xref ref = "example-voting-plurality" /> is there a Condorcet candidate? If so,
                    who?</p>

                <solution>
                    <p>We see above that Hawaii is preferred over Anaheim (6 out of 10 people prefer Hawaii to Anaheim). 
                        Comparing Hawaii to Orlando, we can that 6 out of 10 people ranked Hawaii abover Orlando.</p>
                    <p>Since Hawaii is preferred in a one-to-one comparison to both other choices, Hawaii is the Condorcet 
                        Winner.</p>

                    the affiliations of the candidates. In this election there are three candidates: Don and Key, both

                <p>We can see a total of <m>342+214+298=854</m> voters participated in this election. Computing percentage 
                    of first place votes:</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don: <m>214 \div 854=25.1\%</m></li>
                    <li>Key: <m>298 \div 854=34.9\%</m></li>
                    <li>Elle: <m>342 \div 854=40.0\%</m></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>So in this election, the Democratic voters split their vote over the two Democratic candidates, allowing 
                    the Republican candidate Elle to win under the plurality method with 40% of the vote.</p>

                <p>Analyzing this election closer, we see that it violates the Condorcet Criterion. Analyzing the one-to-one 
                    comparisons:</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Elle vs Don: 342 prefer Elle; 512 prefer Don: Don is preferred</li>
                    <li>Elle vs Key: 342 prefer Elle; 512 prefer Key: Key is preferred</li>
                    <li>Don vs Key: 556 prefer Don; 298 prefer Key: Don is preferred</li>
                </ul></p>
                
                <p>So even though Don had the smallest number of first-place votes in the election, he is the Condorcet 
                    winner, being preferred in every one-to-one comparison with the other candidates.</p>

                candidate that share somewhat similar points of view, can lead to insincere voting. Insincere voting is when 
                a person casts a ballot counter to their actual preference for strategic purposes. In the case above, the 
                democratic leadership might realize that Don and Key will split the vote, and encourage voters to vote for 
                Key by officially endorsing him. Not wanting to see their party lose the election, as happened in the 
                scenario above, Don’s supporters might insincerely vote for Key, effectively voting against Elle.</p>

        <introduction>Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), also called Plurality with Elimination, is a modification of the 
            plurality method that attempts to address the issue of insincere voting.</introduction>
        
        <subsection><title>Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)</title>
            <p>In IRV, voting is done with preference ballots, and a preference schedule is generated. The choice with the 
                least first-place votes is then eliminated from the election, and any votes for that candidate are 
                redistributed to the voters’ next choice. This continues until a choice has a majority (over 50%).</p>

            <p>This is similar to the idea of holding runoff elections, but since every voter’s order of preference is 
            recorded on the ballot, the runoff can be computed without requiring a second costly election.</p>

            <p>This voting method is used in several political elections around the world, including election of members of 
                the Australian House of Representatives, and was used for county positions in Pierce County, Washington 
                until it was eliminated by voters in 2009. A version of IRV is used by the International Olympic Committee 
                to select host nations.</p>

                <p>If this was a plurality election, note that B would be the winner with 9 first-choice votes, compared to 
                    6 for D, 4 for C, and 1 for E.</p>

                <p>There are total of <m>3+4+4+6+2+1 = 20</m> votes. A majority would be <m>11</m> votes. No one yet has a 
                    majority, so we proceed to elimination rounds.</p>

                    <p>Round 1: We make our first elimination. Choice A has the fewest first-place votes, so we remove that 
                        choice.</p>

                        determined earlier that Don was the Condorcet winner. On the other hand, the temptation has been 
                        removed for Don’s supporters to vote for Key; they now know their vote will be transferred to Key, 
                        not simply discarded.</p>

                <p>Now suppose that the results were announced, but election officials accidentally destroyed the ballots 
                    before they could be certified, and the votes had to be recast. Wanting to “jump on the bandwagon”, 10 
                    of the voters who had originally voted in the order Brown, Adams, Carter change their vote to favor the 
                    presumed winner, changing those votes to Adams, Brown, Carter.</p>

                    though the only vote changes made favored Adams, the change ended up costing Adams the election. This 
                    doesn’t seem right, and introduces our second fairness criterion.</p>
            </example>

            <definition><title>Monotonicity Criterion</title>
                <p>If voters change their votes to increase the preference for a candidate, it should not harm that 
                    candidate’s chances of winning.</p>
            </definition>

            <p>This criterion is violated by the election in the previous example. Note that even though the criterion is 
                violated in this 
                particular election, it does not mean that IRV always violates the criterion; just that IRV has the

                    <p>In each of the 51 ballots ranking Seattle first, Puyallup will be given 1 point, Olympia 2 points,

                        allows us to calculate points awarded:</p>
                    
                    <p>Seattle: <m>51 \cdot 4 + 25 \cdot 1 + 10 \cdot 1 + 14\cdot 1 = 253</m> points</p>

        <subsection><title>What's Wrong with Borda Count</title>
            <p>You might have already noticed one potential flaw of the Borda Count from the previous example. In that 
                example, Seattle had a majority of first-choice votes, yet lost the election! This seems odd, and prompts 
                our next fairness criterion:</p>

            <definition><title>Majority Criterion</title>
                <p>If a choice has a majority of first-place votes, that choice should be the winner.</p>
            </definition>

            <p>The election from <xref ref = "example-voting-borda" /> using the Borda Count violates the Majority 
                Criterion. Notice also that this 
                automatically means that the Condorcet Criterion will also be violated, as Seattle would have been 
                preferred by 51% of voters in any head-to-head comparison.</p>

            <p>Borda count is sometimes described as a consensus-based voting system, since it can sometimes choose a more 
                broadly acceptable option over the one with majority support. In the example above, Tacoma is probably the 
                best compromise location. This is a different approach than plurality and instant runoff voting that focus 
                on first-choice votes; Borda Count considers every voter’s entire ranking to determine the outcome.</p>

            <p>Because of this consensus behavior, Borda Count, or some variation of it, is commonly used in awarding 
                sports awards. Variations are used to determine the Most Valuable Player in baseball, to rank teams in NCAA 
                sports, and to award the Heisman trophy.</p>

        <introduction>So far none of our voting methods have satisfied the Condorcet Criterion. The Copeland Method 
            specifically attempts to satisfy the Condorcet Criterion by looking at pairwise (one-to-one) comparisons.

            <definition><title>Copeland’s Method</title>
                <p>In this method, each pair of candidates is compared, using all preferences to determine which of the two 
                    is more preferred. The more preferred candidate is awarded 1 point. If there is a tie, each candidate 
                    is awarded <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> point. After all pairwise comparisons are made, the candidate with the 
                    most points, and hence the most pairwise wins, is declared the winner.</p>
            </definition>

            <p>Variations of Copeland’s Method are used in many professional organizations, including election of the Board 
                of Trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia.</p>

                        <p>You may recall we did this earlier when determining the Condorcet Winner. For example, comparing

                        Hawaii to Orlando. Note that Hawaii doesn’t have to be the voter’s first choice - we’re imagining 
                        that Anaheim wasn’t an option. If it helps, you can imagine removing Anaheim, as in the

                    <p>Based on this, in the comparison of Hawaii vs Orlando, Hawaii wins, and receives 1 point.</p>

                    <p>Comparing Anaheim to Orlando, the 1 voter in the first column clearly prefers Anaheim, as do the 3 
                        voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column clearly prefer Orlando. The 3 voters 
                        in the last column prefer Hawaii as their first choice, but if they had to choose between Anaheim 
                        and Orlando, they'd choose Anaheim, their second choice overall. So, altogether 1+3+3=7 voters 
                        prefer Anaheim over Orlando, and 3 prefer Orlando over Anaheim. So, comparing Anaheim vs Orlando: 7 
                        votes to 3 votes: Anaheim gets 1 point.</p>

                    <p>To sumarize:</p>
                    
                    <p>Hawaii vs Orlando: 6 votes to 4 votes: Hawaii gets 1 point</p>

                    <p>Hawaii vs Anaheim: 6 votes to 4 votes: Hawaii gets 1 point</p>

                    <p>Suddenly Anna is the winner! This leads us to another fairness criterion.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>

            <definition><title>The Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) Criterion</title>
                <p>If a non-winning choice is removed from the ballot, it should not change the winner of the election.</p>
      
                <p>
                Equivalently, if choice A is preferred over choice B, introducing or removing a choice C should not cause B 
                    to be preferred over A.</p>
            </definition>

            <p>In the previous example, the IIA Criterion was violated.</p>

            <p>This anecdote illustrating the IIA issue is attributed to Sidney Morgenbesser:</p>

            <blockquote>After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has 
                two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress 
                returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says "In that case I'll have 
                the blueberry pie."</blockquote>

            <p>Another disadvantage of Copeland’s Method is that it is fairly easy for the election to end in a tie. For 
                this reason, Copeland’s method is usually the first part of a more advanced method that uses more 
                sophisticated methods for breaking ties and determining the winner when there is not a Condorcet Candidate.

            <p>Unfortunately, no. A mathematical economist, Kenneth Arrow, was able to prove in 1949 that there is no 
                voting method that will satisfy all the fairness criteria we have discussed.</p>

            <p>To see a very simple example of how difficult voting can be, consider the election below:</p>
            
            <table>

                    </row>
                </tabular>
            </table>

            <p>Notice that in this election:

            <ul>
                <li>10 people prefer A to B</li>
                <li>10 people prefer B to C</li>
                <li>10 people prefer C to A</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>No matter whom we choose as the winner, 2/3 of voters would prefer someone else! This scenario is dubbed 
                Condorcet’s Voting Paradox, and demonstrates how voting preferences are not transitive (just because A is 
                preferred over B, and B over C, does not mean A is preferred over C). In this election, there is no fair 
                resolution.</p>

            <p>It is because of this impossibility of a totally fair method that Plurality, IRV, Borda Count, Copeland’s 
                Method, and dozens of variants are all still used. Usually the decision of which method to use is based on 
                what seems most fair for the situation in which it is being applied.</p>

            <p>Approval voting can very easily violate the Majority Criterion.</p>

            <example>
                <p>Consider the voting schedule:</p>
                <table>

                    <p>Clearly A is the majority winner. Now suppose that this election was held using Approval Voting, and 
                        every voter marked approval of their top two candidates.</p>

                    <p>A would receive approval from 80 voters</p>
                    <p>B would receive approval from 100 voters</p>
                    <p>C would receive approval from 20 voters</p>
                    <p>B would be the winner.</p>
                    
                </solution>
            </example>
                    
                    
                    <p>Some argue that Approval Voting tends to vote the least disliked choice, 
                        rather than the most liked candidate.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, Approval Voting is susceptible to strategic insincere voting, in which a voter does 
                        not vote their true preference to try to increase the chances of their choice winning. For example, 
                        in the movie example above, suppose Bob and Alice would much rather watch Scream. They remove The 
                        Matrix from their approval list, resulting in a different result.</p>

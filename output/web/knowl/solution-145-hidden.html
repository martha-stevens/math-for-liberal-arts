If we add these, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} 
= \frac{6}{12} + \frac{2}{12} = \frac{8}{12}\)</span> , which is not the correct probability.</div> <div class="para">Looking at the outcomes we can see why: the outcome H6 would have been counted twice, since it contains both a head and a 6; the probability of both a head and rolling a 6 is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{12}\text{.}\)</span> If we subtract out this double count, we have the correct probability: <span class="process-math">\(\frac{8}{12}

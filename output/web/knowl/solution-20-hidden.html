<div class="para">To answer this question, we need to consider how the weight of the dough will scale. The weight will be based on the volume of the dough. However, since both pizzas will be about the same thickness, the weight will scale with the area of the top of the pizza. We can find the area of each pizza using the formula for area of a circle, <span class="process-math">\(A= \pi r^2\text{:}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">A 12” pizza has radius 6 inches, so the area will be <span class="process-math">\(\pi 6^2\)</span>= about 113 square inches.</div> <div class="para">A 16” pizza has radius 8 inches, so the area will be <span class="process-math">\(\pi 8^2\)</span>= about 201 square inches.</div> <div class="para">Notice that if both pizzas were 1 inch thick, the volumes would be 113 in<span class="process-math">\(^3\)</span> and 201 <span class="process-math">\(\text{in}^3\)</span> respectively, which are at the same ratio as the areas. As mentioned earlier, since the thickness is the same for both pizzas, we can safely ignore it</div> <div class="para">We can now set up a proportion to find the weight of the dough for a 16” pizza:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{10\text{ounces}}{113\text{ in}^2} = \frac{x}{201\text{ in}^2}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Multiply both sides by 201</div> <div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(x=201\cdot \frac{10}{113}\)</span> = about 17.8 ounces of dough for a 16” pizza.</div> <div class="para">It is interesting to note that while the diameter is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{16}{12}=1.33\)</span> times larger, the dough required, which scales with area, is <span class="process-math">\(1.33^2=1.78\)</span> times larger.</div>

<div class="para">Z-scores are related to the Empirical Rule from the standpoint of being a method of evaluating how extreme a particular value is in a given set. You can think of a z-score as the number of standard deviations there are between a given value and the mean of the set. While the Empirical Rule allows you to associate the first three standard deviations with the percentage of data that each SD includes, the z-score allows you to state (as accurately as you like), just how many SDs a given value is above or below the mean.</div>

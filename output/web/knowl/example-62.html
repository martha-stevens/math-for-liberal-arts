<div class="para">Suppose you order a team jersey online on Tuesday and want to receive it by Friday so you can wear it to Saturday’s game. The website says that if you pay for expedited shipping, you will receive the jersey by Friday. In what situation is the website telling a lie?</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">There are four possible outcomes:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">You pay for expedited shipping and receive the jersey by Friday</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You pay for expedited shipping and don’t receive the jersey by Friday</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You don’t pay for expedited shipping and receive the jersey by Friday</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You don’t pay for expedited shipping and don’t receive the jersey by Friday</div></li>
</ol>
</div> <div class="para">Only one of these outcomes proves that the website was lying: the second outcome in which you pay for expedited shipping but don’t receive the jersey by Friday. The first outcome is exactly what was promised, so there’s no problem with that. The third outcome is not a lie because the website never said what would happen if you didn’t pay for expedited shipping; maybe the jersey would arrive by Friday whether you paid for expedited shipping or not. The fourth outcome is not a lie because, again, the website didn’t make any promises about when the jersey would arrive if you didn’t pay for expedited shipping.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-logic-conditional.html#example-62" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

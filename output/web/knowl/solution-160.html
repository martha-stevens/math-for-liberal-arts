<div class="para">In many card games (such as poker) the order in which the cards are drawn is not important (since the player may rearrange the cards in his hand any way he chooses); in the problems that follow, we will assume that this is the case unless otherwise stated. Thus we use combinations to compute the possible number of 5-card hands, <span class="process-math">\(_{52}C_{5}\text{.}\)</span> This number will go in the denominator of our probability formula, since it is the number of possible outcomes.</div> <div class="para">For the numerator, we need the number of ways to draw one Ace and four other cards (none of them Aces) from the deck. Since there are four Aces and we want exactly one of them, there will be <span class="process-math">\(_{4}C_{1}\)</span> ways to select one Ace; since there are 48 non-Aces and we want 4 of them, there will be <span class="process-math">\(_{48}C_{4}\)</span> ways to select the four non-Aces. Now we use the Basic Counting Rule to calculate that there will be <span class="process-math">\(_{4}C_{1}\cdot _{48}C_{4}\)</span> ways to choose one ace and four non-Aces.</div> <div class="para">Putting this all together, we have P(one Ace)<span class="process-math">\(=\frac{_{4}C_{1} \cdot _{48}C_{4}}
{_{52}C_{5}}=\frac{778320}{2598960} \approx 0.299\)</span>

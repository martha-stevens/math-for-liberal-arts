<div class="para">For example, suppose you want to schedule a meeting with two colleagues at 4:30PM on Friday, and you need both of them to be available at that time. What situation would make it impossible to have the meeting? It is NOT the case that colleague a is available AND colleague b is available: <span class="process-math">\(\sim \left(a \wedge b\right)\text{.}\)</span> This situation is equivalent to either colleague a NOT being available OR colleague b NOT being available: <span class="process-math">\(\sim a \vee \sim b\text{.}\)</span>

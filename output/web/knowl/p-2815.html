<li><div class="para">Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the <dfn class="terminology">standard divisor</dfn>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the <dfn class="terminology">quota</dfn>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Cut off the decimal part of the quota to obtain the lower quota, which we’ll call <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Compute <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n\left(n+1\right)}\text{,}\)</span> which is the <dfn class="terminology">geometric mean</dfn> of the lower quota and one value higher.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If the quota is larger than the geometric mean, round up the quota; if the quota is smaller than the geometric mean, round down the quota. Add up the resulting whole numbers to get the initial allocation.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If the total from the previous step was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from the previous step was larger than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total in the previous step is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the <dfn class="terminology">modified divisor</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">adjusted divisor</dfn>.</div></li>

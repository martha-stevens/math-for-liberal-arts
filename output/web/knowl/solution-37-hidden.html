From the given data, we know that there are 3 students in region e and 7 students in region h.</div> <div class="para">Since 7 students were taking a SS and NS course, we know that n(d) + n(e) = 7. Since we know there are 3 students in region 3, there must be 7 - 3 = 4 students in region d.</div> <div class="para">Similarly, since there are 10 students taking HM and NS, which includes regions e and f, there must be 10 - 3 = 7 students in region f.</div> <div class="para">Since 9 students were taking SS and HM, there must be 9 - 3 = 6 students in region b.</div> <div class="para">Now, we know that 21 students were taking a SS course. This includes students from regions a, b, d, and e. Since we know the number of students in all but region a, we can determine that 21 - 6 - 4 - 3 = 8 students are in region a.</div> <div class="para">8 students are taking only a SS course.</div>

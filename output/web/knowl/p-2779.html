<div class="para">Thomas Jefferson proposed a different method for apportionment. After Washington vetoed Hamilton’s method, Jefferson’s method was adopted, and used in Congress from 1791 through 1842. Jefferson, of course, had political reasons for wanting his method to be used rather than Hamilton’s. Primarily, his method favors larger states, and his own home state of Virginia was the largest in the country at the time. He would also argue that it’s the ratio of people to representatives that is the critical thing, and apportionment methods should be based on that. But the paradoxes we saw also provide mathematical reasons for concluding that Hamilton’s method isn’t so good, and while Jefferson’s method might or might not be the best one to replace it, at least we should look for other possibilities.</div>

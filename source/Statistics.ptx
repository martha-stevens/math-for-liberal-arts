        <p>Like most people, you probably feel that it is important to "take control of your life." But what does this 
                mean? Partly it means being able to properly evaluate the data and claims that bombard you every day. If you 
                cannot distinguish good from faulty reasoning, then you are vulnerable to manipulation and to decisions that 
                are not in your best interest. Statistics provides tools that you need in order to react intelligently to 
                information you hear or read. In this sense, Statistics is one of the most important things that you can 
                study.</p>

            <p>To be more specific, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are not saying that 
                each one of these claims is true!)</p>
        
        <p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.</li>
                <li>Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.</li>
                <li>Condoms are effective 94% of the time.</li>
                <li>Native Americans are significantly more likely to be hit crossing the streets than are people of 
                    other ethnicities.</li>
                <li>People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and 
                    quickly.</li>
                <li>Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.</li>
                <li>A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.</li>
                <li>People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting 
                    average over 400.</li>
                <li>There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same 
                    birthday.</li>
                <li>79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <p>All of these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar; if not, we bet 
                that you have heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples are; they come from psychology, 
                health, law, sports, business, etc. Indeed, data and data-interpretation show up in discourse from virtually 
                every facet of contemporary life.</p>

            <p>Statistics are often presented in an effort to add credibility to an argument or advice. You can see this by 
                paying attention to television advertisements. Many of the numbers thrown about in this way do not represent 
                careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading, and push you into decisions that you might find cause 
                to regret. For these reasons, learning about statistics is a long step towards taking control of your life. 
                (It is not, of course, the only step needed for this purpose.) These chapters will help you learn 
                statistical essentials. It will make you into an intelligent consumer of statistical claims.</p>

            <p>You can take the first step right away. To be an intelligent consumer of statistics, your first reflex must 
                be to question the statistics that you encounter. The British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli famously 
                said, "There are three kinds of lies -- lies, damned lies, and statistics." This quote reminds us why it is 
                so important to understand statistics. So let us invite you to reform your statistical habits from now on. 
                No longer will you blindly accept numbers or findings. Instead, you will begin to think about the numbers, 
                their sources, and most importantly, the procedures used to generate them.</p>

            <p>We have put the emphasis on defending ourselves against fraudulent claims wrapped up as statistics. Just as 
                important as detecting the deceptive use of statistics is the appreciation of the proper use of statistics. 
                You must also learn to recognize statistical evidence that supports a stated conclusion. When a research 
                team is testing a new treatment for a disease, statistics allows them to conclude based on a relatively 
                small trial that there is good evidence their drug is effective. Statistics allowed prosecutors in the 
                1950’s and 60’s to demonstrate racial bias existed in jury panels. Statistics are all around you, sometimes 
                used well, sometimes not. We must learn how to distinguish the two cases.</p>
                
        <p>Before we begin gathering and analyzing data we need to characterize the population we are studying. If we want 
            to study the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical first-year college student, our population might be 
            all first-year students at your college. Or it might be:</p>
         <p>
        <ul>
            <li>All first-year community college students in the state of Washington.</li>
            <li>All first-year students at public colleges and universities in the state of Washington.</li>
            <li>All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the state of Washington.</li>
            <li>All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.</li>
        </ul> </p>
        
        <definition><title>Population</title>
            <p>The <term>population</term> of a study is the group the collected data is intended to describe.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>Sometimes the intended population is called the target population, since if we design our study badly, the 
            collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.</p>

        <p>Why is it important to specify the population? We might get different answers to our question as we vary the 
            population we are studying. First-year students at the University of Washington might take slightly more diverse 
            courses than those at your college, and some of these courses may require less popular textbooks that cost more; 
            or, on the other hand, the University Bookstore might have a larger pool of used textbooks, reducing the cost of 
            these books to the students. Whichever the case (and it is likely that some combination of these and other 
            factors are in play), the data we gather from your college will probably not be the same as that from the 
            University of Washington. Particularly when conveying our results to others, we want to be clear about the 
            population we are describing with our data.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the 
                population?</p>

            <solution><p>While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of 
                the survey is readers of the website.</p>

                <p>If we were able to gather data on every member of our population, say the average (we will define 
                    "average" more carefully in a subsequent section) amount of money spent on textbooks by each first-year 
                    student at your college during the 2009-2010 academic year, the resulting number would be called a 
                    parameter.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        
        <definition>
            <title>Parameter</title>
            <p>A <term>parameter</term> is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using all the data 
                from a population.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>We seldom see parameters, however, since surveying an entire population is usually very time-consuming and 
            expensive, unless the population is very small or we already have the data collected.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Census</title>
            <p>A survey of an entire population is called a <term>census</term>.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>You are probably familiar with two common censuses: the official government Census that attempts to count the 
            population of the U.S. every ten years, and voting, which asks the opinion of all eligible voters in a district. 
            The first of these demonstrates one additional problem with a census: the difficulty in finding and getting 
            participation from everyone in a large population, which can bias, or skew, the results.</p>

        <p>There are occasionally times when a census is appropriate, usually when the population is fairly small. For 
            example, if the manager of Starbucks wanted to know the average number of hours her employees worked last week, 
            she should be able to pull up payroll records or ask each employee directly.</p>

        <p>Since surveying an entire population is often impractical, we usually select a sample to study.</p>

        <definition><title>Sample</title>
            <p>A <term>sample</term> is a smaller subset of the entire population, ideally one that is fairly representative 
                of the whole population.</p>
        </definition>

            <p>We will discuss sampling methods in greater detail in a later section. For now, let us assume that samples 
                are chosen in an appropriate manner. If we survey a sample, say 100 first-year students at your college, and 
                find the average amount of money spent by these students on textbooks, the resulting number is called a 
                statistic.</p>
            
            <definition><title>Statistic</title>
                <p>A <term>statistic</term> is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using the data from a sample.
                </p>
            </definition>
            
            <example>

                <p>A researcher wanted to know how citizens of Tacoma felt about a voter initiative. To study this, she goes 
                    to the Tacoma Mall and randomly selects 500 shoppers and asks them their opinion. 60% indicate they are 
                    supportive of the initiative. What is the sample and population? Is the 60% value a parameter or a 
                    statistic?</p>

                <solution>
                    <p>The sample is the 500 shoppers questioned. The population is less clear. While the intended 
                        population of this survey was Tacoma citizens, the effective population was mall shoppers. There is 
                        no reason to assume that the 500 shoppers questioned would be representative of all Tacoma 
                        citizens.</p>


                    <p>The 60% value was based on the sample, so it is a statistic.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>

            <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                <p>To determine the average length of trout in a lake, researchers catch 20 fish and measure them. What is 
                    the sample and population in this study?</p>
                
                <answer>The sample is the 20 fish caught. The population is all fish in the lake. The sample may be somewhat 
                    unrepresentative of the population since not all fish may be large enough to catch the bait.</answer>
            </problem>

            <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                <p>A college reports that the average age of their students is 28 years old. Is this a statistic or a 
                    parameter?</p>
                
                <answer>This is a parameter, since the college would have access to data on all students (the population).
                </answer>
            </problem>
            
        <p>Once we have gathered data, we might wish to classify it. Roughly speaking, data can be classified as categorical 
            data or quantitative data.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Quantitative and Categorical Data</title>
            <p>Categorical (qualitative) data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the objects under 
                investigation into various categories.</p>
            <p>Quantitative data are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can perform meaningful 
                arithmetic calculations.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>We might conduct a survey to determine the name of the favorite movie that each person in a math class saw in 
                a movie theater.</p>

            <p>When we conduct such a survey, the responses would look like: Finding Nemo, The Hulk, or Terminator 3: Rise 
                of the Machines. We might count the number of people who give each answer, but the answers themselves do not 
                have any numerical values: we cannot perform computations with an answer like "Finding Nemo." This would be 
                categorical data.</p>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>A survey could ask the number of movies you have seen in a movie theater in the past 
                12 months (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)</p>

            <p>This would be quantitative data.</p>
        </example>
        

        <p>Other examples of quantitative data would be the running time of the movie you saw most recently (104 minutes, 
            137 minutes, 104 minutes, ...) or the amount of money you paid for a movie ticket the last time you went to a 
            movie theater ($5.50, $7.75, $9, ...).</p>

        <p>Sometimes, determining whether or not data is categorical or quantitative can be a bit trickier.</p>

        <example><p>Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location.</p>

            <p>ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful mathematical calculations with them (it doesn't make 
                sense to say that 98036 is "twice" 49018 — that's like saying that Lynnwood, WA is "twice" Battle Creek, MI, 
                which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data.</p>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>A survey about the movie you most recently attended includes the question "How would you rate the movie you 
                just saw?" with these possible answers:</p>

            <p>1 - it was awful</p>
            <p>2 - it was just OK</p>
            <p>3 - I liked it</p>
            <p>4 - it was great</p>
            <p>5 - best movie ever!</p>

            <p>Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but we can't really do any calculations with them: a 
                movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; if two 
                people see the movie and one of them thinks it stinks and the other thinks it's the best ever it doesn't 
                necessarily make sense to say that "on average they liked it."</p>
            
        </example>

        <p>As we study movie-going habits and preferences, we shouldn't forget to specify the population under 
            consideration. If we survey 3-7 year-olds the runaway favorite might be Finding Nemo. 13-17 year-olds might 
            prefer Terminator 3. And 33-37 year-olds might prefer...well, Finding Nemo.</p>

        <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
            <p>Classify each measurement as categorical or quantitative:

        <title>Sampling Methods and Sampling Bias</title>
        <objectives>
            <ul>
                <li>Compare sampling methods, such as simple random sampling, quota sampling, and 
                    convienence sampling</li>

            </ul>
        </objectives>
        
        <p>As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a survey is to identify the 
            population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a politician to determine the amount of support he has 
            among the electorate should he decide to run for another term. What population should we study? Every person in 
            the district? Not every person is eligible to vote, and regardless of how strongly someone likes or dislikes the 
            candidate, they don't have much to do with him being re-elected if they are not able to vote.</p>

        <p>What about eligible voters in the district? That might be better, but if someone is eligible to vote but does not 
            register by the deadline, they won't have any say in the election either. What about registered voters? Many 
            people are registered but choose not to vote. What about "likely voters?"</p>

        <p>This is the criteria used in much political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a "likely voter." Is 
            it someone who voted in the last election? In the last general election? In the last presidential election? 
            Should we consider someone who just turned 18 a "likely voter?" They weren't eligible to vote in the past, so 
            how do we judge the likelihood that they will vote in the next election?</p>

        <p>In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse "The Body" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up 
            until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several 
            contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:</p>
         <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate 
                race.</li>
            <li>Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a 
                professional wrestler.</li>
            <li>The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to 
                vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.</li>
        </ul> </p>

        <p>But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young 
            people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in the 
            gubernatorial election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young 
            people have a lower rate of voter registration and a turnout rate for elections) and so the polling samples were 
            subject to sampling bias: they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning 
            candidate.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Sampling Bias</title>
            <p>A sampling method is biased if every member of the population doesn’t have equal likelihood of being in the 
                sample.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>So even identifying the population can be a difficult job, but once we have identified the population, how do we 
            choose an appropriate sample? Remember, although we would prefer to survey all members of the population, this 
            is usually impractical unless the population is very small, so we choose a sample. There are many ways to sample 
            a population, but there is one goal we need to keep in mind: we would like the sample to be representative of 
            the population.</p>

        <p>Returning to our hypothetical job as a political pollster, we would not anticipate very accurate results if we 
            drew all of our samples from among the customers at a Starbucks, nor would we expect that a sample drawn 
            entirely from the membership list of the local Elks club would provide a useful picture of district-wide support 
            for our candidate.</p>

        <p>One way to ensure that the sample has a reasonable chance of mirroring the population is to employ randomness. 
            The most basic random method is simple random sampling.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Simple Random Sample</title>
            <p>A random sample is one in which each member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen. A 
                simple random sample is one in which every member of the population and any group of members has an equal 
                probability of being chosen.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>If we could somehow identify all likely voters in the state, put each of their names on a piece of paper, 
                toss the slips into a (very large) hat and draw 1000 slips out of the hat, we would have a simple random 
                sample.</p>
        </example>

        <p>In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor than millions of slips of paper and extremely 
            large headgear.</p>

        <p>It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally representative of the 
            population. If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among the population of likely voters in the state 
            of Washington, some of these samples might tend to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or 
            Republicans) than does the general population; some samples might include more older people and some samples 
            might include more younger people; etc. In most cases, this sampling variability is not significant.</p>

        <definition><title>Sampling Variability</title>
            <p>The natural variation of samples is called sampling variability.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>This is unavoidable and expected in random sampling, and in most cases is not an issue.</p>

        <p>To help account for variability, pollsters might instead use a stratified sample.</p>

        <definition><title>Stratified Sampling</title>
            <p>In stratified sampling, a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are 
                then taken from each subgroup with sample sizes proportional to the size of the subgroup in the population.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>Suppose in a particular state that previous data indicated that the electorate was comprised of 39% 
                Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they would then expect to get 
                about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 independents. To accomplish this, they could randomly select 
                390 people from among those voters known to be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 
                from those with no party affiliation.</p>
        </example>

        <p>Stratified sampling can also be used to select a sample with people in desired age groups, a specified mix ratio 
            of males and females, etc. A variation on this technique is called quota sampling.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Quota Sampling</title>
            <p>Quota sampling is a variation on stratified sampling, wherein samples are collected in each subgroup until 
                the desired quota is met.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>Suppose the pollsters call people at random, but once they have met their quota of 390 Democrats, they only 
                gather people who do not identify themselves as a Democrat.</p>
        </example>

        <p>You may have had the experience of being called by a telephone pollster who started by asking you your age, 
            income, etc. and then thanked you for your time and hung up before asking any "real" questions. Most likely, 
            they already had contacted enough people in your demographic group and were looking for people who were older or 
            younger, richer or poorer, etc. Quota sampling is usually a bit easier than stratified sampling, but also does 
            not ensure the same level of randomness.</p>

        <p>Another sampling method is cluster sampling, in which the population is divided into groups, and one or more 
            groups are randomly selected to be in the sample.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Cluster Sampling</title>
            <p>In cluster sampling, the population is divided into subgroups (clusters), and a set of subgroups are selected 
                to be in the sample.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>If the college wanted to survey students, since students are already divided into classes, they could 
                randomly select 10 classes and give the survey to all the students in those classes. This would be cluster 
                sampling.</p>
        </example>

        <definition><title>Systematic Sampling</title>
            <p>In systematic sampling, every nth member of the population is selected to be in the sample.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>To select a sample using systematic sampling, a pollster calls every 100th name in the phone book.</p>
            <p>Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your name is Albert Aardvark and your 
                sister Alexis Aardvark is right after you in the phone book, there is no way you could both end up in the 
                sample) but it can yield acceptable samples.</p>
        </example>

        <p>Perhaps the worst types of sampling methods are convenience samples and voluntary response samples.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Convenience Sampling and Voluntary Response Sampling</title>
            <p>Convenience sampling is samples chosen by selecting whoever is convenient.</p>

            <p>Voluntary response sampling is allowing the sample to volunteer.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>A pollster stands on a street corner and interviews the first 100 people who agree to speak to him. This is a 
                convenience sample.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>A website has a survey asking readers to give their opinion on a tax proposal. This is a self-selected 
                sample, or voluntary response sample, in which respondents volunteer to participate.</p>
        </example>

        <p>Usually voluntary response samples are skewed towards people who have a particularly strong opinion about the 
            subject of the survey or who just have way too much time on their hands and enjoy taking surveys.</p>

        <p>There are number of ways that a study can be ruined before you even start collecting data. The first we have 
            already explored - sampling or selection bias, which is when the sample is not representative of the population. 
            One example of this is voluntary response bias, which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who 
            volunteer to participate. This is not the only potential source of bias.</p>
        
        <note><title>Sources of bias</title>
            <p>Some sources of bias in studies are:
            <ul>
                <li>Sampling bias - when the sample is not representative of the population</li>
                <li>Voluntary response bias - the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is volunteers</li>
                <li>Self-interest study - bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the outcome</li>
                <li>Response bias - when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason</li>
                <li>Perceived lack of anonymity - when the responder fears giving an honest answer might negatively 
                    affect them</li>
                <li>Loaded questions - when the question wording influences the responses</li>
                <li>Non-response bias - when people refusing to participate in the study can influence the 
                    validity of the outcome</li>
                </ul> </p>
        </note>

        <example>
            <p>Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers[1]. This study was 
                conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example 
                of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. 
                While this does not necessarily ensure that the study was biased, it certainly suggests that we should 
                subject the study to extra scrutiny.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>A survey asks people “when was the last time you visited your doctor?” This might suffer from response bias, 
                since many people might not remember exactly when they last saw a doctor and give inaccurate responses.</p>
        </example>

        <p>Sources of response bias may be innocent, such as bad memory, or as intentional as pressuring by the pollster. 
            Consider, for example, how many voting initiative petitions people sign without even reading them.</p>

        <example>
            <p>A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with members of other races. Here, a perceived 
                lack of anonymity could influence the outcome. The respondent might not want to be perceived as racist even 
                if they are, and give an untruthful answer.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment 
                help. Here, answering truthfully might have consequences; responses might not be accurate if the employees 
                do not feel their responses are anonymous or fear retribution from their employer.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>A survey asks “do you support funding research of alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-
                polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question - questions whose wording leads 
                the respondent towards an answer.</p>
        </example>

        <p>Loaded questions can occur intentionally by pollsters with an agenda, or accidentally through poor question 
            wording. Also a concern is question order, where the order of questions changes the results. A psychology 
            researcher provides an example:</p>

        <blockquote>My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied are you with your 
            life? 
            How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not statistically related - you would conclude that there is 
            no relationship between dating frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How 
            often do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship was a strong one. 
            You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a student's life as dating frequency.</blockquote>

        <example>
            <p>A telephone poll asks the question “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?”, and 50% of the people 
                called refused to answer the survey. It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire 
                population. This is an example of non-response bias, introduced by people refusing to participate in a study 
                or dropping out of an experiment. When people refuse to participate, we can no longer be so certain that our 
                sample is representative of the population.</p>

        <p>So far, we have primarily discussed observational studies - studies in which conclusions would be drawn from 
            observations of a sample or the population. In some cases these observations might be unsolicited, such as 
            studying the percentage of cars that turn right at a red light even when there is a “no turn on red” sign. In 
            other cases the observations are solicited, like in a survey or a poll.</p>

        <p>In contrast, it is common to use experiments when exploring how subjects react to an outside influence. In an

            </answer>
        </problem>

        <p>When conducting experiments, it is essential to isolate the treatment being tested.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Suppose a middle school (junior high) finds that their students are not scoring well on the state’s 
                standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if an alternate curriculum would improve 
                scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. 
                To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.</p>
        </example>

        <p>The difficulty with this scenario is that it is not clear whether the curriculum is responsible for the 
            improvement, or whether the improvement is due to a math specialist teaching the class. This is called 
            confounding - when it is not clear which factor or factors caused the observed effect. Confounding is the 
            downfall of many experiments, though sometimes it is hidden.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Confounding</title>
            <p>Confounding occurs when there are two potential variables that could have caused the outcome and it is not 
                possible to determine which actually caused the result.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>A drug company study about a weight loss pill might report that people lost an average of 8 pounds while 
                using their new drug. However, in the fine print you find a statement saying that participants were 
                encouraged to also diet and exercise. It is not clear in this case whether the weight loss is due to the 
                pill, to diet and exercise, or a combination of both. In this case confounding has occurred.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>Researchers conduct an experiment to determine whether students will perform better on an arithmetic test if 
                they listen to music during the test. They first give the student a test without music, then give a similar 
                test while the student listens to music. In this case, the student might perform better on the second test, 
                regardless of the music, simply because it was the second test and they were warmed up.</p>
        </example>

        <p>There are a number of measures that can be introduced to help reduce the likelihood of confounding. The primary 
            measure is to use a control group.</p>

        <definition><title>Control Group</title>
            <p>When using a control group, the participants are divided into two or more groups, typically a control group 
                and a treatment group. The treatment group receives the treatment being tested; the control group does not 
                receive the treatment.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>Ideally, the groups are otherwise as similar as possible, isolating the treatment as the only potential source of 
            difference between the groups. For this reason, the method of dividing groups is important. Some researchers 
            attempt to ensure that the groups have similar characteristics (same number of females, same number of people 
            over 50, etc.), but it is nearly impossible to control for every characteristic. Because of this, random 
            assignment is very commonly used.</p>

        <example>
            <p>To determine if a two day prep course would help high school students improve their scores on the SAT test, a 
                group of students was randomly divided into two subgroups. The first group, the treatment group, was given a 
                two day prep course. The second group, the control group, was not given the prep course. Afterwards, both 
                groups were given the SAT.</p>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>A company testing a new plant food grows two crops of plants in adjacent fields, the treatment group 
                receiving the new plant food and the control group not. The crop yield would then be compared. By growing 
                them at the same time in adjacent fields, they are controlling for weather and other confounding factors.
            </p>
        </example>

        <p>Sometimes not giving the control group anything does not completely control for confounding variables. For 
            example, suppose a medicine study is testing a new headache pill by giving the treatment group the pill and the 
            control group nothing. If the treatment group showed improvement, we would not know whether it was due to the 
            medicine in the pill, or a response to have taken any pill. This is called a placebo effect.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Placebo Effect</title>
            <p>The placebo effect is when the effectiveness of a treatment is influenced by the patient’s perception of how 
                effective they think the treatment will be, so a result might be seen even if the treatment is ineffectual.
            </p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>A study found that when doing painful dental tooth extractions, patients told they were receiving a strong 
                painkiller while actually receiving a saltwater injection found as much pain relief as patients receiving a 
                dose of morphine.</p>
        </example>
        
        <p>To control for the placebo effect, a placebo, or dummy treatment, is often given to the control group. This way, 
            both groups are truly identical except for the specific treatment given.</p>

        <definition><title>Placebo and Placebo controlled experiments</title>
            <p>A placebo is a dummy treatment given to control for the placebo effect. An experiment that gives the control 
                group a placebo is called a placebo controlled experiment.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>In a study for a new medicine that is dispensed in a pill form, a sugar pill could be used as a placebo.</p>
            <p>In a study on the effect of alcohol on memory, a non-alcoholic beer might be given to the control group as a 
                placebo.</p>
            <p>In a study of a frozen meal diet plan, the treatment group would receive the diet food, and the control could 
                be given standard frozen meals stripped of their original packaging.</p>
        </example>
        
        <p>In some cases, it is more appropriate to compare to a conventional treatment than a placebo. For example, in a 
            cancer research study, it would not be ethical to deny any treatment to the control group or to give a placebo 
            treatment. In this case, the currently acceptable medicine would be given to the control group, sometimes called 
            a comparison group in this case. In our SAT test example, the non-treatment group would most likely be 
            encouraged to study on their own, rather than be asked to not study at all, to provide a meaningful comparison.
        </p>

        <p>When using a placebo, it would defeat the purpose if the participant knew they were receiving the placebo.</p>

        <definition><title>Blind Studies</title>
            <p>A blind study is one in which the participant does not know whether or not they are receiving the treatment 
            or a placebo. A double-blind study is one in which those interacting with the participants don’t know who is in 
            the treatment group and who is in the control group.</p>
        </definition>
        
    <example>
        <p>In a study about anti-depression medicine, you would not want the psychological evaluator to know whether the 
            patient is in the treatment or control group either, as it might influence their evaluation, so the experiment 
            should be conducted as a double-blind study.</p>
        </example>

        <p>It should be noted that not every experiment needs a control group.</p>

        <example>
            <p>If a researcher is testing whether a new fabric can withstand fire, she simply needs to torch multiple 
                samples of the fabric - there is no need for a control group.</p>
        </example>
        
        <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
            <p>To test a new lie detector, two groups of subjects are given the new test. One group is asked to answer all 
                the questions truthfully, and the second group is asked to lie on one set of questions. The person 
                administering the lie detector test does not know what group each subject is in.</p>

            <p>Does this experiment have a control group? Is it blind, double-blind, or neither?</p>
            
            <answer>The truth-telling group could be considered the control group, but really both groups are treatment 
                groups here, since it is important for the lie detector to be able to correctly identify lies, and also not 
                identify truth telling as lying. This study is blind, since the person running the test does not know what 
                group each subject is in.</answer>

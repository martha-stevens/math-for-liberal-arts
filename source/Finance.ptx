        <introduction>
            <p>We have to work with money every day.  While balancing your checkbook or calculating 
                your monthly expenditures on espresso requires only arithmetic, when we start saving, 
                planning for retirement, or need a loan, we need more mathematics.  </p>
                   
            <p>This chapter covers the mathematics involved in computing interest, working with annuities,
              and amortized loans.</p>

            <p>Discussing interest starts with the <term>principal</term>, or amount your account starts with.  This could 
                be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan.  Interest, in its most simple form, is 
                calculated as a percent of the principal.</p>  
            <p>For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of 
                interest you would pay would just be 5% of 100:  $100(0.05) = $5.  
                The total amount you would repay would be $105, the original principal plus the interest. </p>
            
            <definition><title>Simple One-time Interest</title>
                <p>Simple interest can be computed with:
                    <me>I = P_0rt</me>
                    <me>A = P_0 + I = P_0 + P_0rt = P_0\left(1+rt\right)</me>
                    where,</p>

                <p>I is the interest</p>
                <p>A is the end amount: principal plus interest</p>
                <p><m>P_0</m> is the principal (starting amount)</p>
                <p>r is the interest rate (in decimal form.  Example: 5% = 0.05)</p>
            </definition>
            
            <example>
                <p>A friend asks to borrow $300 and agrees to repay it in 30 days with 3% interest.  How much 
                    interest will you earn?</p>
                
                <solution>
                    <p><m>P_0 = \$300</m> (the principal)</p>
                    <p><m>r = 0.03</m> (3% interest rate)</p>
                    <p><m>I = \$300\left(0.03\right) = \$9</m></p>
                    <p>You will earn $9 interest.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>
            
            <p>One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term loans.  For longer term 
                loans, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.  In 
                that case, interest would be earned regularly.  For example, bonds are essentially a loan made 
                to the bond issuer (a company or government) by you, the bond holder.  In return for the 
                loan, the issuer agrees to pay interest, often annually.  Bonds have a maturity date, at which 
                time the issuer pays back the original bond value.</p> 
            
            
            <example><p>Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it.  
                You obtain a $1,000 bond that pays 5% interest annually that matures in 5 years.   How much 
                interest will you earn?</p>
                
                <solution><p>Each year, you would earn 5% interest:  $1000(0.05) = $50 in interest.  So over the course of 
                    five years, you would earn a total of $250 in interest.  When the bond matures, you would 
                    receive back the $1,000 you originally paid, leaving you with a total of $1,250.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>
            
            <p>We can generalize this idea of simple interest over time.</p>
 
            <definition><title>Simple Interest over Time</title>
                <p>To compute simple sinterest over time,
                    <me>I = P_0rt</me>
                    <me>A = P_0 + I = P_0 + P_0rt = P_0\left(1 + rt\right)</me>
                    where,
                </p>

                <p>I is the interest</p>
                <p>A is the end amount: principal plus interest</p>
                <p><m>P_0</m> is the principal (starting amount)</p>
                <p>r is the interest rate in decimal form</p>
                <p>t is time</p>
 
                <p>The units of measurement (years, months, etc.) for the time should match the time 
                period for the interest rate.</p>
            </definition>
 
            <definition><title>APR - Annual Percentage Rate</title>
                <p>Interest rates are usually given as an annual percentage rate (APR) - the total interest 
                    that will be paid in the year.  If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR 
                    will be divided up.</p>
 
                <p>For example, a 6% APR paid monthly would be divided into twelve 0.5% payments. 
                    A 4% annual rate paid quarterly would be divided into four 1% payments.</p>
            </definition>
            
            <example>
                 <p>Treasury Notes (T-notes) are bonds issued by the federal government to cover its expenses.  
                    Suppose you obtain a $1,000 T-note with a 4% annual rate, paid semi-annually, with a 
                     maturity in 4 years.  How much interest will you earn?</p>
 
                <solution><p>Since interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), the 4% interest will be divided into 
                    two 2% payments.</p>
 
                    <p><m>P_0 = \$1000</m>   the principal</p>
                    <p><m>r = 0.02</m>    2% rate per half-year</p>
                    <p><m>t = 8</m>     4 years = 8 half-years</p>
                    <p><m>I = \$1000\left(0.02\right)\left(8\right) = \$160.</m></p>
                    <p>You will earn $160 interest total over the four years.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>
            
            <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                 <p>A loan company charges $30 interest for a one month loan of $500.  Find the annual interest 
                     rate they are charging.</p>
                
                <answer>72% interest</answer>
                
                <solution>Using <m>I = P_0rt</m>, we get <m>30 = 500\cdot r \cdot 1</m>.  Solving, we get r = 0.06, or 6%.  
                    Since the time was monthly, this is the monthly interest.  
                    The annual rate would be 12 times this: 72% interest.</solution>
            </problem>

        </subsection>
        
        <subsection><title>Compound Interest</title>
            <p>With simple interest, we were assuming that we pocketed the interest when we received it.  
                In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and 
                we earn interest on that interest in future years.  This reinvestment of interest is called 
                compounding.</p> 
 
            <p>Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly.  
                How will our money grow?</p>
 

            <p>The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) - the total interest to be paid during the 
                year.  Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn 12
                %3 = 0.25% per month.</p>
 

            <p>In the first month,</p>
            <md>
                <mrow>P_0 \amp = \$1000</mrow> 
                <mrow>r \amp = 0.0025</mrow>
                <mrow>I \amp = \$1000 \left(0.0025 \right) = \$2.50</mrow> 
                <mrow>A \amp = \$1000 + \$2.50 = \$1002.50</mrow>
            </md>
            <p>In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.</p>
            
            <p>In the second month,</p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>P_0 \amp = \$1002.50 </mrow>
                    <mrow>I \amp = \$1002.50 \left(0.0025\right) = \$2.51</mrow>
                    <mrow>A \amp = \$1002.50 + \$2.51 = \$1005.01</mrow>
                </md>
                
            <p>Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month.  This 
                is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned 
                interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month.  This is the key advantage that 
                compounding of interest gives us.</p>

        <p>To find an equation to represent this, if Pm represents the amount of money after m months, 
            then we could write the recursive equation:</p> 
 
            <p><m>P_0 = \$1000</m></p> 
            <p><m>P_m = \left(1+0.0025 \right)P_{m-1}</m></p> 
 

        <p>You probably recognize this as the recursive form of exponential growth.  If not, we could go 
        through the steps to build an explicit equation for the growth:</p>
            
        <md>
            <mrow>P_0 \amp= \$1000</mrow>
            <mrow>P_1 \amp= 1.0025P_0 = 1.0025 \left(1000\right)</mrow> 
            <mrow>P_2 \amp= 1.0025P_1 = 1.0025 \left(1.0025 \left(1000\right)\right) = 1.0025^2 \left(1000\right)</mrow> 
            <mrow>P_3 \amp= 1.0025P_2 = 1.0025 \left(1.0025^2\left(1000\right)\right) = 1.0025^3\left(1000\right)</mrow> 
            <mrow>P_4 \amp= 1.0025P_3 = 1.0025 \left(1.0025^3\left(1000\right)\right) = 1.0025^4\left(1000\right)</mrow>
        </md>
 

            <p>Observing a pattern, we could conclude</p>
 

            <me>P_m = \left(1.0025\right)^m\left(\$1000\right)</me> 
 

            <p>Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P0, the starting amount.  We found 1.0025 by 
            adding one to the growth rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year.     
                Generalizing our result, we could write</p>
                
                <me>P_m = P_0 \left(1 + \frac{r}{k}\right)^m</me>
         
            <p>In this formula:</p> 
            <p><m>m</m> is the number of compounding periods (months in our example)</p>
            <p><m>r</m> is the annual interest rate </p>
            <p><m>k</m> is the number of compounds per year.</p>
 

            <p>While this formula works fine, it is more common to use a formula that involves the number of years, 
                rather than the number of compounding periods.  If <m>N</m> is the number of years, then  
                <m>m = N k</m>.  Making this change gives us the standard formula for compound interest.</p>
            
            
            <definition><title>Compound Interest</title>
                <p>The compound interest formula is:</p>
                <me>P_N = P_0 \left( 1 + \frac{r}{k} \right)^{Nk}</me>

                <p><m>P_N</m>  is the balance in the account after <m>N</m> years.</p>
                <p><m>P_0</m>  is the starting balance of the account (also called initial deposit, or principal)</p>
                <p><m>r</m> is the annual interest rate in decimal form </p>
                <p><m>k</m> is the number of compounding periods in one year.   </p>
            </definition>
 

            <p>If the compounding is done annually (once a year), <m>k = 1</m>.</p> 
            <p>If the compounding is done quarterly, <m>k = 4</m>.</p> 
            <p>If the compounding is done monthly, <m>k = 12</m>.</p>
            <p>If the compounding is done daily, <m>k = 365</m>.</p>
            
            <p>The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put 
                money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.</p>
            
            <example>
                <p>A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer.  It usually gives a 
                    higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time.  
                    Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% interest, compounded monthly.  How much 
                    will you have in the account after 20 years?</p>
                
                <solution>
                    <p>In this example, </p> 
                    <p><m>P_0 = \$3000</m> (the initial deposit)</p>
                    <p><m>r = 0.06</m> (6% annual rate)</p>
                    <p><m>k = 12</m> (12 months in 1 year)</p>
                    <p><m>N = 20</m> (since we’re looking for how much we’ll have after 20 years)</p>
                    
                    <me>P_{20} = 3000 \left(1 + \frac{.06}{12}\right)^{20 \cdot 12} = \$9930.61</me>
                </solution>
            </example>
            
            <p>Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding against the amount you 
                would earn from simple interest.</p>

            <p>As you can see, over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the 
                account balance.  You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and 
                exponential growth.</p>
            
            <note><title>Evaluating exponents on the calculator</title>
                <p>When we need to calculate something like <m>5^3</m> it is easy enough to just multiply 
                    <m>5\cdot 5 \cdot 5=125</m>.  But when we need to calculate something like <m>1.005^{240}</m>, 
                    it would be very tedious to calculate this by multiplying 1.005 by itself 240 times!  
                    So to make things easier, we can harness the power of our scientific calculators.</p>  
 
                <p>Most scientific calculators have a button for exponents.  It is typically either labeled 
                    like:</p>
                <p> <alert>^</alert>, <alert><m>y^x</m></alert>, or <alert><m>x^y</m></alert></p>
 
                <p>To evaluate <m>1.005^{240}</m>  we'd type <kbd>1.005</kbd> <kbd>^</kbd> <kbd>240</kbd>. 
                    Try it out - you should get something around 3.3102044758.</p>

            <example>
                <p>You know that you will need $40,000 for your child’s education in 18 years.  If your account 
                    earns 4% compounded quarterly, how much would you need to deposit now to reach your 
                    goal?</p>
 
                <solution><p>In this example, we’re looking for <m>P_0</m>.</p>

                    <p>In this case, we’re going to have to set up the equation, and solve for <m>P_0</m>.</p>

            <note><title>Rounding</title>
                <p>It is important to be very careful about rounding when calculating things with 
                exponents.  In general, you want to keep as many decimals during calculations as you 
                can.  Be sure to keep at least 3 significant digits (numbers after any leading zeros).  
                Rounding 0.00012345 to 0.000123 will usually give you a “close enough” answer, but 
                    keeping more digits is always better.</p>
            </note>
            
            <example>
                <p>To see why not over-rounding is so important, suppose you were investing $1000 at 5% 
                    interest compounded monthly for 30 years.</p>

        <p>If you’re working in a bank, of course you wouldn’t round at all.  For our purposes, the 
            answer we got by rounding to 0.00417, three significant digits, is close enough - $5 off of 
            $4500 isn’t too bad.  Certainly keeping that fourth decimal place wouldn’t have hurt.</p>

        </objectives>
        
        <p>For most of us, we aren’t able to put a large sum of money in the bank today. Instead, we
            save for the future by depositing a smaller amount of money from each paycheck into the
            bank. This idea is called a savings annuity. Most retirement plans like 401k plans or IRA
            plans are examples of savings annuities.</p>
        
         <p>An annuity can be described recursively in a fairly simple way. Recall that basic compound
            interest follows from the relationship</p>
        
        <me>P_m = \left(1 + \frac{r}{k}\right) P_{m-1}</me>

        <p>For a savings annuity, we simply need to add a deposit, <m>d</m>, to the account with each
        compounding period:</p>
            
            <me>P_m = \left( 1 + \frac{r}{k}\right) P_{m-1} + d</me>

        <p>Taking this equation from recursive form to explicit form is a bit trickier than with
        compound interest. It will be easiest to see by working with an example rather than working
            in general.</p>
        
        <p>Suppose we will deposit $100 each month into an account paying 6% interest. We assume
            that the account is compounded with the same frequency as we make deposits unless stated
            otherwise. In this example:</p>
        
        <p><m>r = 0.06</m> (6%)</p>
        <p><m>k = 12</m> (12 compounds/deposits per year)</p>
        <p><m>d = \$100</m> (our deposit per month)</p>
        
        <p>Writing out the recursive equation gives</p>
        
        <me>P_m = \left(1 + \frac{0.06}{12}\right)P_{m-1} + 100 = \left(1.005\right)P_{m-1} + 100</me>

        <p>Assuming we start with an empty account, we can begin using this relationship:</p>

        <p>Continuing this pattern, after m deposits, we’d have saved:</p>
        
        <me>P_m = 100\left(1.005\right)^{m-1} + 100\left(1.005\right)^{m-2}+ \ldots + 100\left(1.005\right) + 100</me>

        <p>In other words, after <m>m</m> months, the first deposit will have earned compound interest for <m>m-1</m>
            months. The second deposit will have earned interest for <m>m-2</m> months. Last months deposit
            would have earned only one month worth of interest. The most recent deposit will have
            earned no interest yet.</p>
        
        <p>This equation leaves a lot to be desired, though - it doesn’t make calculating the ending
                balance any easier! To simplify things, multiply both sides of the equation by 1.005, and distribute on

        <p>Now we’ll line this up with like terms from our original equation, and subtract each side</p>

                <li>Solve applications involving payout annuities</li>
            </ul>
        </objectives>
        
        <p>In the last section you learned about annuities. In an annuity, you start with nothing, put
            money into an account on a regular basis, and end up with money in your account.</p>
       
        <p>In this section, we will learn about a variation called a Payout Annuity. With a payout
            annuity, you start with money in the account, and pull money out of the account on a regular
            basis. Any remaining money in the account earns interest. After a fixed amount of time, the
            account will end up empty.</p>
        
        <p>Payout annuities are typically used after retirement. Perhaps you have saved $500,000 for
            retirement, and want to take money out of the account each month to live on. You want the
            money to last you 20 years. This is a payout annuity. The formula is derived in a similar
            way as we did for savings annuities. The details are omitted here.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Payout Annuity Formula</title>
            <p>To compute the balance at the beginning of a payout annuity with regular withdrawals of d,</p>
            <me>P_0=\frac{d \left(1 - \left(1+\frac{r}{k}\right)^{-Nk}\right)}{\left(\frac{r}{k}\right)}</me>
            <p><m>P_0</m> is the balance in the account at the beginning (starting amount, or principal).</p>
            <p><m>d</m> is the regular withdrawal (the amount you take out each year, each month, etc.)</p>
            <p><m>r</m> is the annual interest rate (in decimal form. Example: 5% = 0.05)</p>
            <p><m>k</m> is the number of compounding periods in one year.</p>
            <p><m>N</m> is the number of years we plan to take withdrawals</p>
        </definition>
        
        <p>Like with annuities, the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is
            determined by how often you take the withdrawals.</p>
        
        <note><title>When do you use this?</title>
            <p>Payout annuities assume that you take money from the account on a regular schedule
                (every month, year, quarter, etc.) and let the rest sit there earning interest.</p>
            <p>Compound interest: One deposit</p>
            <p>Annuity: Many deposits.</p>

            <p>After retiring, you want to be able to take $1000 every month for a total of 20 years from
                your retirement account. The account earns 6% interest. How much will you need in your
                account when you retire?</p>

                <p>You will need to have $139,600 in your account when you retire.</p>

                <p>Notice that you withdrew a total of $240,000 ($1000 a month for 240 months). The
                    difference between what you pulled out and what you started with is the interest earned. In
                    this case it is $240,000 - $139,600 = $100,400 in interest.</p>

        <note><title>Evaluating negative exponents on your calculator</title>
            <p>With these problems, you need to raise numbers to negative powers. Most calculators
            have a separate button for negating a number that is different than the subtraction
                button. Some calculators label this <kbd>(-)</kbd> , some with <kbd>+/-</kbd>. The button is often near the
                <kbd>=</kbd> key or the decimal point.</p>
            
            <p>If your calculator displays operations on it (typically a calculator with multiline
                display), to calculate <m>1.005^{-240}</m> you'd type something like: 1.005 <kbd>^</kbd> <kbd>(-)</kbd> 240</p>
            
            <p>If your calculator only shows one value at a time, then usually you hit the <kbd>(-)</kbd> key after
                a number to negate it, so you'd hit: 1.005 <kbd>^</kbd> 240 <kbd>(-)</kbd> <kbd>=</kbd></p>

see why, imagine that you had $10,000 invested at a bank, and started taking out payments
while earning interest as part of a payout annuity, and after 5 years your balance was zero.
Flip that around, and imagine that you are acting as the bank, and a car lender is acting as
you. The car lender invests $10,000 in you. Since you’re acting as the bank, you pay
            interest. The car lender takes payments until the balance is zero.</p>
        
            <definition><title>Loans Formula</title>
            <p>The loans formula is</p>
            <me>P_0=\frac{d\left(1 - \left(1+\frac{r}{k}\right)^{-Nk}\right)}{\left(\frac{r}{k}\right)}</me>
            <p><m>P_0</m> is the balance in the account at the beginning (the principal, or amount of the loan).</p>
            <p><m>d</m> is your loan payment (your monthly payment, annual payment, etc)</p>
            <p><m>r</m> is the annual interest rate in decimal form.</p>
            <p><m>k</m> is the number of compounding periods in one year.</p>
            <p><m>N</m> is the length of the loan, in years</p>
        </definition>
        
        <p>Like before, the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is determined by
            how often you make payments.</p>

        <note><title>When do you use this?</title>
            <p>The loan formula assumes that you make loan payments on a regular schedule (every
    month, year, quarter, etc.) and are paying interest on the loan.</p>
            <p>Compound interest: One deposit</p>
            <p>Annuity: Many deposits.</p>
            <p>Payout Annuity: Many withdrawals</p>
            <p>Loans: Many payments</p>
        </note>
        
        <example>
            <p>You can afford $200 per month as a car payment. If you can get an auto loan at 3% interest
for 60 months (5 years), how expensive of a car can you afford? In other words, what
                amount loan can you pay off with $200 per month?</p>
            
            <solution>
                <p>In this example,</p>
                <p><m>d = \$200</m> the monthly loan payment</p>
                <p><m>r = 0.03</m> 3% annual rate</p>
                <p><m>k = 12</m> since we’re doing monthly payments, we’ll compound monthly</p>
                <p><m>N = 5</m> since we’re making monthly payments for 5 years</p>
                <p>We’re looking for <m>P_0</m>, the starting amount of the loan.</p>
                
                <me>P_0=\frac{200\left(1 - \left(1+\frac{0.03}{12}\right)^{-5\cdot 12}\right)}{\left( \frac{0.03}{12}\right)}</me>
                
                <me>P_0 = \frac{200\left(1-\left(1.0025\right)^{-60}\right)}{0.0025}</me>
                
                <me>P_0 = 11,120</me>
                
                <p>You can afford a $11,120 loan.</p>

                <p>You will pay a total of $12,000 ($200 per month for 60 months) to the loan company. The
difference between the amount you pay and the amount of the loan is the interest paid. In
                    this case, you’re paying $12,000-$11,120 = $880 interest total.</p>
                
            </solution>
            
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>You want to take out a $140,000 mortgage (home loan). The interest rate on the loan is 6%,
                and the loan is for 30 years. How much will your monthly payments be?</p>

            <solution><p>In this example, we’re looking for d.</p>
                <p><m>r = 0.06</m> 6% annual rate</p>
                <p><m>k = 12</m> since we’re paying monthly</p>
                <p><m>N = 30</m> 30 years</p>
                <p><m>P_0 = \$140,000</m> the starting loan amount</p>

                <p>In this case, we’re going to have to set up the equation, and solve for d.</p>
                
                <me>140000 = \frac{d\left(1 - \left(1 + \frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{-30\cdot 12}\right)}{\left(\frac{0.06}{12}\right)}</me>
                <me>140000 = \frac{d\left(1 - \left(1.005\right)^{-360}\right)}{0.005}</me>
                
                <me>140000 = d \left(166.792 \right)</me>
                
                <me>d = \frac{140000}{166.792}=\$839.37</me>
                
                <p>You will make payments of $839.37 per month for 30 years. </p>

                <p>You’re paying a total of $302,173.20 to the loan company: $839.37 per month for 360
months. You are paying a total of $302,173.20 - $140,000 = $162,173.20 in interest over the
                    life of the loan. </p>

            <p>Janine bought $3,000 of new furniture on credit. Because her credit score isn’t very good,
                the store is charging her a fairly high interest rate on the loan: 16%. If she agreed to pay off
                the furniture over 2 years, how much will she have to pay each month?</p>
            
            <answer><p>Solving for d gives $146.89 as monthly payments.</p>

                <p>In total, she will pay $3,525.36 to the store, meaning she will pay $525.36 in interest over the

        <subsection><title>Amortization Schedules</title>
            <p>Consider a 5-year loan for $10,000 with yearly payments.  If the interest rate is 12%,
                we can compute the yearly payments.  But how much interest are we paying each year?  How much of our payments are 
                going toward the principal of the loan?</p>
                
                <p>We can create a table, also called an <term>amortization schedule</term> to show 
                    how the interest is spread out over the payments of the loan.</p>
            
            <p>First, using the loans formula, we can solve for <m>d</m>, or the amount of each payment.</p>
            
            <me>10000 = \frac{d\left(1 - \left(1 + \frac{.12}{1}\right)^{-5 \cdot 1}\right)}{\left(\frac{.12}{1}\right)}</me>
            
            <me>10000 = \frac{d \left(1 - \left(1.12\right)^{-5}\right)}{.12}</me>
            
            <me>10000 = d \left(3.6048 \right)</me>
            
            <me>d = 10000 \div 3.6048 = 2774.08</me>
            
            <p>We will make 5 annual payments of $2,774.08.  That means, we are paying a total of
                <m>2774.08 \times 5 = 13870.40</m> to pay off this loan. Since we borrowed
                $10,000, the difference is interest. $13,870.40 - $10,000 = $3,870.40.</p>
            
            <p>Since we owe more money at the beginning of the loan, we should expect to pay more interest in beginning. We 
                can see how this works in <xref ref="table-amort">Table</xref> below.</p>

</table>
            
            <p>Before we make our first payment, we owe $10,000.  We will pay 12% annual interest on that amount:
                <me>I = \$10000\cdot .12 \cdot 1 = \$1200</me>
                which is $1,200. That means $1,200 of our first payment is interest.  The rest of the $2,774.08 will go 
                toward the principal of the loan.</p>
            
            <p>Since $2,774.08 - $1,200 = $1,574.08, the balance (or principal) of the loan will be reduced by
                $1,574.08</p>
            
            <p>After our first payment, the balance of the loan is $10,000 - $1,574.08 = $8,425.92</p>
            
            <p>This information is summarized in the first row of the amortization schedule in
                <xref ref="table-amort"></xref>.</p>
            
            <p>To determine the interest in that second payment, we have to take 12% of the new balance ($8.425.92):
                <me>I = \$8,425.92 \cdot .12 \cdot 1 = \$1,011.11</me>
            </p>
            
            <p>In the second payment, $2,774.08 - $1,011.11 = $1,762.97 will reduce the balance of the loan.  That means,
                the balance of the loan after the second payment is: $8.425.92 - $1,792.97 = $6,662.95</p>
            
            <p>To find the interest in the third payment we can take 12% of this new balance--$6,662.95.</p>
            
            <p>We can continue this pattern to complete the rest of the table.</p>
            
            <p>The remaining balance of 10 cents at the end of the loan is a result of rounding that was 
                used to compute the loan payments. A lender wouldn't actually do any rounding, and the entire balance of the loan would
                be paid off at the end of the 5 years.</p>
            
            <example><p>Create the first two lines of an amortization schedule for a 30-year mortgage for $150,000 at 6% 
                interest with monthly payments.</p>
                
                <solution><p>
                    First we need to find the amount of the monthly payment (or d) using our loans formula:</p>
                    
                    <me>150000 = \frac{d\left(1 - \left(1 + \frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{-30\cdot 12}\right)}{\left(\frac{0.06}{12}\right)}</me>
                <me>150000 = \frac{d\left(1 - \left(1.005\right)^{-360}\right)}{0.005}</me>
                
                <me>150000 = d \left(166.792 \right)</me>
                
                <me>d = \frac{150000}{166.792}=\$899.32</me>
                
               <p>Now we can compute the amount of interest owed during that first month of the loan. Using our
                   simple interest formula,</p>
                    <me>I = P_0 r t</me>
                    <me>I = 150000 \left( 0.06 \right) \left(\frac{1}{12}\right)</me>
                    <me>I = 750</me>
                    
                    <p>Recall, that <m>t</m> is measured in years. One month = <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> year.</p>
                    <p>This means $750 of our first payment is interest.  The rest, $899.32 - $750 = $149.32, 
                        will go toward the balance of the loan.</p>
                    
                    <p>The new balance of the loan can be obtained by subtracting $149.32 from $150,000 to get 
                        $149,850.68.</p>

                        owed during the second month of the loan, we can use the
                   simple interest formula,</p>

                    <me>I = 749.25</me>
                    
                    <p>Notice that we still <m>\frac{1}{12}</m> year for <m>t</m> because we are interested in the interest
                        that we owe over one month (specifically the second month) of the loan.</p>
                    <p>This means $749.25 of our second payment is interest.  The rest, $899.32 - $749.25 = $150.07, 
                        will go toward the balance of the loan.</p>
                    
                    <p>The new balance of the loan can be obtained by subtracting $150.07 from $149,850.68 to get 
                        $149,700.61.</p>

        <subsection><title>Remaining Loan Balance</title>
            <p>With loans, it is often desirable to determine what the remaining loan balance will be after
some number of years. For example, if you purchase a home and plan to sell it in five years,
you might want to know how much of the loan balance you will have paid off and how much
                you have to pay from the sale.</p>

            <p>To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to know
the loan payments, if we don’t already know them. Remember that only a portion of your
loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For
example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will not have paid off
                $12,000 of the loan balance.</p>
            
            <p>To determine the remaining loan balance, we can think “how much loan will these loan
                payments be able to pay off in the remaining time on the loan?”</p>
            
            <example>
                <p>If a mortgage at a 6% interest rate has payments of $1,000 a month, how much will the loan
                    balance be 10 years from the end the loan?</p>

                <solution>
                    <p>To determine this, we are looking for the amount of the loan that can be paid off by $1,000 a
                        month payments in 10 years. In other words, we’re looking for <m>P_0</m> when</p>
                    <p><m>d = \$1,000</m> the monthly loan payment</p>
                    <p><m>r = 0.06</m> 6% annual rate</p>
                    <p><m>k = 12</m> since we’re doing monthly payments, we’ll compound monthly</p>
                    <p><m>N = 10</m> since we’re making monthly payments for 10 more years</p>
                    
                    <me>P_0=\frac{1000\left(1 - \left(1+\frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{-10\cdot 12}\right)}{\left( \frac{0.06}{12}\right)}</me>
                
                <me>P_0 = \frac{1000\left(1-\left(1.005\right)^{-120}\right)}{0.005}</me>
                
                <me>P_0 = 90,073.45</me>
                    
                   
                    <p>The loan balance with 10 years remaining on the loan will be $90,073.45</p>
                </solution>
            </example>

            <p>Often times answering remaining balance questions requires two steps:
               <ol label = "1">
                   <li>Calculating the monthly payments on the loan</li>
                   <li>Calculating the remaining loan balance based on the remaining time on the loan</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
            <example>
                <p>A couple purchases a home with a $180,000 mortgage at 4% for 30 years with monthly
                    payments. What will the remaining balance on their mortgage be after 5 years?</p>

                <solution><p>First we will calculate their monthly payments.
                    We’re looking for d.</p>
                    <p><m>r = 0.04</m> 4% annual rate</p>
                    <p><m>k = 12</m> since they’re paying monthly</p>
                    <p><m>N = 30</m> years</p>
                    <p><m>P_0 = \$180,000</m> the starting loan amount</p>
                    <p>We set up the equation and solve for d.</p>
                    
                    <me>180000 = \frac{d\left(1 - \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{12}\right)^{-30\cdot 12}\right)}{\left(\frac{0.04}{12}\right)}</me>
                <me>180000 = \frac{d\left(1 - \left(1.00333\right)^{-360}\right)}{0.00333}</me>
                
                <me>180000 = d \left(209.562 \right)</me>
                
                <me>d = \frac{180000}{209.562}=\$858.93</me>
                    
                    <p>Now that we know the monthly payments, we can determine the remaining balance. We
                    want the remaining balance after 5 years, when 25 years will be remaining on the loan, so we
                    calculate the loan balance that will be paid off with the monthly payments over those 25
                    years.</p>
                        <p><m>d = \$858.93</m> the monthly loan payment we calculated above</p>
                        <p><m>r = 0.04</m> 4% annual rate</p>
                        <p><m>k = 12</m> since they’re doing monthly payments</p>
                        <p><m>N = 25</m> since they'd be making monthly payments for 25 more years</p>
                        
                        <me>P_0=\frac{858.93\left(1 - \left(1+\frac{0.04}{12}\right)^{-25\cdot 12}\right)}{\left(\frac{0.04}{12}\right)}</me>
                
                <me>P_0 = \frac{858.93\left(1-\left(1.00333\right)^{-300}\right)}{0.00333}</me>
                
                <me>P_0 = 162,758</me>
                        
                        <p>The loan balance after 5 years, with 25 years remaining on the loan, will be $162,758</p>

                        <p>Over that 5 years, the couple has paid off $180,000 - $162,758 = $17,242 of the loan balance.
                            They have paid a total of $858.93 a month for 5 years (60 months), for a total of $51,535.80,
                            so $51,535.80 - $17,242 = $34,292.80 of what they have paid so far has been interest.</p>

        <subsection><title>Which Equation to Use?</title>
            
            <p>When presented with a finance problem (on an exam or in real life), you're usually not told
what type of problem it is or which equation to use. Here are some hints on deciding which
                equation to use based on the wording of the problem.</p>

            <p>The easiest types of problem to identify are loans. Loan problems almost always include
words like: "loan", "amortize" (the fancy word for loans), "finance (a car)", or "mortgage" (a
home loan). Look for these words. If they're there, you're probably looking at a loan
problem. To make sure, see if you're given what your monthly (or annual) payment is, or if
                you're trying to find a monthly payment.</p>

            <p>If the problem is not a loan, the next question you want to ask is: "Am I putting money in an
account and letting it sit, or am I making regular (monthly/annually/quarterly) payments or
withdrawals?" If you're letting the money sit in the account with nothing but interest
changing the balance, then you're looking at a compound interest problem. The exception
would be bonds and other investments where the interest is not reinvested; in those cases
                you’re looking at simple interest.</p>
            
            <p>If you're making regular payments or withdrawals, the next questions is: "Am I putting
money into the account, or am I pulling money out?" If you're putting money into the
account on a regular basis (monthly/annually/quarterly) then you're looking at a
basic Annuity problem. Basic annuities are when you are saving money. Usually in an
                annuity problem, your account starts empty, and has money in the future.</p>

            <p>If you're pulling money out of the account on a regular basis, then you're looking at a Payout
Annuity problem. Payout annuities are used for things like retirement income, where you
start with money in your account, pull money out on a regular basis, and your account ends
                up empty in the future.</p>

            <p>Remember, the most important part of answering any kind of question, money or otherwise,
is first to correctly identify what the question is really asking, and to determine what
                approach will best allow you to solve the problem.</p>
            
            <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                <p>For each of the following scenarios, determine if it is a compound interest problem, a savings
                    annuity problem, a payout annuity problem, or a loans problem. Then solve each problem.</p>

                    <m>250,000 - 329.21 = 249,670.79.</m></p>
                
                <p>The interest owed during the second month is computed using that new balance of the loan:
                    <me>I = 249670.79 \left(0.045\right)\left(\frac{1}{12}\right) = 936.27</me>
                </p>
                
                <p>Then the amount that will go toward the balance of the loan is <m>1266.71 - 936.27 = 330.44</m>.
                    The balance of the loan is now <m>249,670.79 - 330.44 = 249,340.35</m>.</p>

                <p>Julia puts $100 in an account that pays 4% interest (compounded yearly) every year for 10 years. 
                    Then she lets her money sit in the account, without making payments, for another 15 years.
                    <ol label = "a">
                        <li>How much money will she have in the account?</li>

            <solution>
                <p>First, use the annuity formula to compute the amount of money she will have after 10 years of 
                    making deposits.</p>
                
                <me>P_n = \frac{100\left(\left(1+\frac{0.04}{1}\right)^{10 \cdot 1}-1\right)}{\left(\frac{0.04}{1}\right)}</me>
                <me>P_n = \frac{100\left(\left(1.04\right)^{10}-1\right)}{0.04}=1200.61</me>
                
                <p>Then use the compound interest formula to find the future value of $1200.61 is after sitting in the 
                    account for 15 years.</p>
                
                <me>P_n = 1200.61\left(1+\frac{0.04}{1}\right)^{15 \cdot 1}</me>
                <me>P_n = 1200.61\left(1.04\right)^{15}=2162.23</me>
                
                <p>The total amount in the account will be $2,162.23.  Julia made a total of 10 payments of $100 into the account. 
                    <me>10 \cdot 100 = 1000</me>
                    <me>I = 2162.23 - 1000 = 1162.23</me>
                    She earned $1,162.23 in interest.</p>

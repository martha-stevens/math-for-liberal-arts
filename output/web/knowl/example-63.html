<div class="para">A friend tells you “If you upload that picture to Facebook, you’ll lose your job.” Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">There are four possible outcomes:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">You upload the picture and lose your job</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You upload the picture and don’t lose your job</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You don’t upload the picture and lose your job</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You don’t upload the picture and don’t lose your job</div></li>
</ol>
</div> <div class="para">There is only one possible case in which you can say your friend was wrong: the second outcome in which you upload the picture but still keep your job. In the last two cases, your friend didn’t say anything about what would happen if you didn’t upload the picture, so you can’t say that their statement was wrong. Even if you didn’t upload the picture and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn’t upload the picture; you might lose your job for missing a shift or punching your boss instead.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-logic-conditional.html#example-63" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="para">A distribution is an evaluation of the way that points in a data set are clustered or spread across their range of values. A normal distribution is a very specific symmetrical distribution that indicates, among other things, that exactly <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> of the data is below the mean, and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> is above, that approximately 68% of the data is within 1, approximately 95% of the data is within 2, and approximately 99.7% is within 3 standard deviations of the mean.</div>

<div class="para">The first steps of Jefferson’s method are the same as Hamilton’s method. He finds the same divisor and the same quota, and cuts off the decimal parts in the same way, giving a total number of representatives that is less than the required total. The difference is in how Jefferson resolves that difference. He says that since we ended up with an answer that is too small, our divisor must have been too big. He changes the divisor by making it smaller, finding new quotas with the new divisor, cutting off the decimal parts, and looking at the new total, until we find a divisor that produces the required total.</div>

<div class="para">As above, the number of possible outcomes of the lottery drawing is <span class="process-math">\(_{48}C_{6}=12,271,512\text{.}\)</span> In order to win the second prize, five of the six numbers on the ticket must match five of the six winning numbers; in other words, we must have chosen five of the six winning numbers and one of the 42 losing numbers. The number of ways to choose 5 out of the 6 winning numbers is given by <span class="process-math">\(_{6}C_{5}=6\)</span> and the number of ways to choose 1 out of the 42 losing numbers is given by <span class="process-math">\(_{42}C_{1}=42\text{.}\)</span> Thus the number of favorable outcomes is then given by the Basic Counting Rule: <span class="process-math">\(_{6}C_{5}\cdot _{42}C_{1}=6\cdot 42=252\text{.}\)</span>

    <title>Normal Distributions</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>The normal distribution can be found practically everywhere, from the distribution of human heights to IQ scores. 
    In this chapter, you will learn about applications of normal distributions, the Empirical rule, and the concept and 
        calculation of z-scores.</p>

        <introduction>If you knew that the prices of t-shirts sold in an online shopping site were <term>normally 
            distributed</term>, 
            and had a mean cost of $10, with a standard deviation of $1.50, how could that information benefit you as you 
            are looking at various t-shirt prices on the site? How could you use what you know if you were looking to make a 
            profit by purchasing unusually inexpensive shirts to resell at prices that are more common?</introduction>
        
        <subsection><title>The Normal Distribution</title>
            <p>A distribution is an evaluation of the way that points in a data set are clustered or spread across their 
                range of values. A normal distribution is a very specific symmetrical distribution that indicates, among 
                other things, that exactly <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> of the data is below the mean, and <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is 
                above, that approximately 68% of the 
                data is within 1, approximately 95% of the data is within 2, and approximately 99.7% is within 3 standard 
                deviations of the mean.</p>

            <p>There are a number of reasons that it is important to become familiar with the normal distribution, as you 
                will discover throughout this chapter. Examples of values associated with normal distribution:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical characteristics such as height, weight, arm or leg length, etc.</li>
                <li>The percentile rankings of standardized testing such as the ACT and SAT</li>
                <li>The volume of water produced by a river on a monthly or yearly basis</li>
                <li>The velocity of molecules in an ideal gas</li>
            </ul></p>
            
            <p>Knowing that the values in a set are exactly or approximately normally distributed allows you to get a feel 
                for how common a particular value might be in that set. Because the values of a normal distribution are 
                predictably clustered around the mean, you can estimate in short order the rarity of a given value in the 
                set. In our upcoming lesson on the Empirical Rule, you will see that it is worth memorizing that normally 
                distributed data has the characteristics mentioned above:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>50% of all data points are above the mean and 50% are below</li>
                <li>Approximately 68% of all data points are within 1 standard deviation of the mean</li>
                <li>Approximately 95% of all data points are within 2 standard deviations of the mean</li>
                <li>Approximately 99.7% of all data points are within 3 standard deviations of the mean</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>In this lesson, we will be practicing a ‘rough estimate’ of the probability that a value within a given range 
                will occur in a particular set of data, just to develop an intuition of the use of a normal distribution. In 
                subsequent lessons, we will become more specific with our estimates. The image below will be used in greater 
                detail in the lesson on the Empirical Rule, but you may use it as a reference for this lesson also.</p>

        <subsection><title>Examples</title>
            <p>
            <ol label = "1">
                <li>
                    <p>Human height is commonly considered an approximately normally distributed measure. If the mean height 
                        of a male adult in the U.S.A. is 5'10", with a standard deviation of 1.5", how common are men with 
                        heights greater than 6'2"?</p>

                    <p>Since each standard deviation of this normally distributed data is 1.5", and 6'2" is 4" above the 
                        mean for the population, 6'2" is nearly 3 standard deviations above the mean. That tells us that men 
                        taller than 6'2" are quite rare in this population.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>If the fuel mileage of a particular model of car is normally distributed, with a mean of 26 mpg and a 
                    standard deviation of 2 mpg, how common are cars with a fuel efficiency of 24 to 25 mpg?</p>

                    <p>We know that approximately 68% of the cars in the population have an efficiency of between 24 and 28 
                        mpg, since that would be 1 SD below and 1 SD above the mean. That suggests that apx 34% have an 
                        efficiency of 24 to 26 mpg, so we can say that it is uncommon to see a car with an efficiency 
                        between 24 and 25 mpg, but not extremely so.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>If the maximum jumping height of U.S. high school high jumpers is normally distributed with a mean of 
                    5'11.5" and a SD of 2.2", how unusual is it to see a high school jumper clear 6'3"?</p>

                    <p>If the mean is 5'11.5", then 1 SD above is 6'1.7" and 2 SD’s is 6'3.9". That means that less than 
                        2.5% of jumpers 6'3.9", so it would be pretty uncommon to see a high-school competitor exceed 6'3".
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol></p>
            
            <p>For the examples below assume the data to be normally distributed, and describe the rarity of an event using 
                the following scale:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>0% - &lt; 1% probability = very rare</li> 
                <li>1% - &lt; 5% = rare</li>
                <li>5% - &lt; 34% = uncommon</li>
                <li>34% - &lt; 50% = common</li>
                <li>50% - 100% = likely</li>
            </ul></p>
            
            <example>
                <p>If the mean (<m>\mu</m>) of the data is 75, and the standard deviation (<m>\sigma</m>) is 5, how common is a value 
                    between 70 and 75?</p>
                
                <solution><p>A value of 70 is only 1 standard deviation below the mean, so a value between 70 and 75 would 
                    be expected approximately 34% of the time, so it would be common.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>

            <example>
                <p>If the <m>\mu</m> is .02 and the standard deviation is .005, how common is a value 
                    between .005 and .01?</p>
                
                <solution><p>A value of .01 is 2 SD's below the mean, and .005 is 3 SD's below, so we would expect there to 
                    be about a 2.5% probability of a value occurring in that range. A value between 0.005 and 0.01 would be 
                    rare.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>
            
            <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                <p>If the mean is 1280 and the standard deviation is 70, how common is a value between 1210 and 1350?</p>
                
                <answer>1210 is 1 SD below the mean, and 1350 is 1 SD above the mean, so we would expect approximately 68% 
                    of the data to be in that range, meaning that is it likely that a value in that range would occur.
                </answer>
            </problem>

            <example>
                <p>If the mean defect rate at a cellphone production plant is 0.1%, with a standard deviation of 0.03%, would 
                    it seem reasonable for a quality assurance manager to be concerned about 3 defective phones in a single 
                    1000 unit run?</p>
                
                <solution>
                    <p>0.1% translates into 1 per thousand, with a standard deviation of 3 per ten thousand. That means that 
                        3 defects in the same thousand is nearly 7 SD’s above the mean, well into the very rare category. 
                        While it is not impossible for random chance to result in such a value, it would certainly be 
                        prudent for the manager to investigate.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>


            
            <p>Returning to the problem, we started with:</p>

            <blockquote>If you knew that the prices of t-shirts sold in an online shopping site were normally distributed, and had a 
                mean cost of $10, with a standard deviation of $1.50, how could that information benefit you as you are 
                looking at various t-shirt styles and designs on the site? How could you use what you know if you were 
                looking to make a profit by purchasing unusually inexpensive shirts to resell at prices that are more 
                common?</blockquote>

            <p>By knowing the mean and SD of the shirt prices, and knowing that they are normally distributed, you can 
                estimate right away if a shirt is priced at a point significantly below the norm. For instance, with this 
                data, we can estimate that a shirt priced at $7.00 is less expensive than apx 97.5% of all shirts on the 
                site, and could likely be resold at a profit (assuming there is not something wrong the shirt that is not 
                obvious from the listing).</p>

        <p>If the price per pound of USDA Choice Beef is normally distributed with a mean of $4.85/lb and a standard

            chosen market) will be between $5.20 and $5.55 per pound?</p>
        
        <p>This lesson on the Empirical Rule is an extension of the previous lesson 
            <xref ref = "section-normal-understanding" />. In the prior lesson, the 
            goal was to develop an intuition of the interaction between decreased probability and increased distance from 
            the mean. In this lesson, we will practice applying the Empirical Rule to estimate the specific probability of 
            occurrence of a sample based on the range of the sample, measured in standard deviations.</p>

                <p>This one is slightly different, since we aren’t looking for the probability of a limited range of values. 
                    We want to evaluate the probability of a value occurring anywhere below 5'5". Since the domain of a 
                    normal distribution is infinite, we can’t actually state the probability of the portion of the 
                    distribution on ‘that end’ because it has no ‘end’! What we need to do is add up the probabilities that 
                    we do know and subtract them from 100% to get the remainder.</p>

                    that 50% of U.S. females are taller than 5'8", and gives us a solid starting point to calculate from. 
                    There is another 34% between 5'6.5" and 5'8" and a final 13.5% between 5'5" and 5'6.5". Ultimately that 
                    totals: <m>50\%+34\%+13.5\%=87.5\%</m>.</p>

                <p>Since 87.5% of U.S. females are 5'5" or taller, that leaves 12.5% that are less than 5'5" tall.</p>

            randomly chosen market) will be between $5.20 and $5.55 per pound?</blockquote>

        <p>$5.20 is <m>\mu + 1 \sigma</m>, and $5.55 is <m>\mu + 2\sigma</m>, so the probability of a value occurring in

            <answer><p><m>17.5 = \mu + 3\sigma</m>. Since we are looking for all data above that point, we can

                <li>Compute z-scores</li>
                <li>Use a z-score table to calculate probabilities</li>
            </ul>
        </objectives>
        <p>Using the Empirical Rule can give you a good idea of the probability of occurrence of a value that happens to 
            be exactly one, two or three to either side of the mean, but how do you compare the probabilities of values 
            that are in between standard deviations?</p>
        
        <p>Z-scores are related to the Empirical Rule from the standpoint of being a method of evaluating how extreme a 
            particular value is in a given set. You can think of a z-score as the number of standard deviations there are 
            between a given value and the mean of the set. While the Empirical Rule allows you to associate the first 
            three standard deviations with the percentage of data that each SD includes, the z-score allows you to state 
            (as accurately as you like), just how many SDs a given value is above or below the mean.</p>

        <p>Conceptually, the z-score calculation is just what you might expect, given that you are calculating the number 
            of SDs between a value and the mean. You calculate the z-score by first calculating the difference between 
            your value and the mean, and then dividing that amount by the standard deviation of the set. The formula looks 
            like this:</p>
        
        <me>z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}</me>
        
        <p>where <m>z</m> is the z-score corresponding to a data value (<m>x</m>) in a normal distribution with a mean 
            of <m>\mu</m> and a standard deviation of <m>\sigma</m>.</p>

            <p>In this lesson, we will practice calculating the z-score for various values. In the next lesson, we will 
                learn how to associate the z-score of a value with the probability that the value will occur.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>What is the z-score of a value of 27, given a set mean of 24, and a standard deviation of 2?</p>
            
            <solution>
                <p>To find the z-score we need to divide the difference between the value, 27, and the mean, 24, by the 
                    standard deviation of the set, 2.</p>
                
                <me>z = \frac{27 - 24}{2} = \frac{3}{2}</me>
                
                <p>The z-score of 27 is <m>z = 1.5</m>. This indicates that 27 is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>What is the z-score of a value of <m>104.5</m>, in a set with <m>\mu = 125</m> and <m>\sigma = 6.2</m>?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Find the difference between the given value and the mean, then divide it by the standard deviation.</p>
                
                <me>z = \frac{104.5 - 125}{6.2}= \frac{-20.5}{6.2} = -3.306</me>
                
                <p>The z-score of 104.5 is <m>z = -3.306</m>. Note that the z-score is negative, since the measured value, 
                    <m>104.5</m>, is less than (below) the mean, <m>125</m>.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>This one requires that we solve for a missing value rather than for a missing z-score, so we just need 
                    to fill in our formula with what we know and solve for the missing value:</p>
                
                <me>z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}</me>
                <me>2.403 = \frac{x - 63}{4.25}</me>
                
                <p>To solve for <m>x</m>, we can mutliply both sides by <m>4.25</m></p>
                
                <me>10.213 = x - 63</me>

            <p>What is the z-score of the weight of a cow that tips the scales at 825 lbs, if the mean weight for cows of 
                her type is 1150 lbs, with a standard deviation of 77 lbs?</p>
            
            <answer><m>z = \frac{825 - 1150}{77} = -4.2407</m></answer>
        </problem>
        
        <p>Knowing the z-score of a given value is great, but what can you do with it? How does a z-score relate to 
            probability? What is the probability of occurrence of a z-score less than +2.47?</p>
        
        <p>Since z-scores are a measure of the number of SDs between a value and the mean, they can be used to calculate 
            probability by comparing the location of the z-score to the area under a normal curve either to the left or 
            right. The area can be calculated using calculus, but we will just use a table to look up the area.</p>
        
        <p>In order to find the values for z-scores that aren’t integers, you can use a table like the one below. To find 
            the value associated with a given z-score, you find the first decimal of your z-score on the left or right 
            side and then the 2nd decimal of your z-score across the top or bottom of the table. Where they intersect you 
            will find the decimal expression of the percentage of values that are less than your sample.</p>

</table>
        
        <p>Z-score tables like the one above describe the probability that a given value, or any value less than it, will 
            occur in a given set. This particular table assumes you are looking to find the probability associated with a 
            positive z-score. You may have additional work to do if the z-score is negative.</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>To find the percentage of values greater than a negative Z score, just look up the matching positive Z 
                score value.</li>
            <li>To find the percentage of values less than a negative z-score, subtract the chart value from 1.</li>
            <li>To find the percentage of values greater than a positive z-score, subtract the chart value from 1.</li>
        </ul></p>
        
        <example>
            <p>What is the probability that a value with a z-score less than 2.47 will occur in a normal distribution?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Scroll up to the table above and find “2.4” on the left or right side. Now move across the table to 
                    “0.07” on the top or bottom, and record the value in the cell: <m>0.9932</m>. That tells us that 99.32% 
                    of values in the set are at or below a z-score of 2.47.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>What is the probability that a value with a z-score greater than 1.53 will occur in a normal distribution?
            </p>

            <solution>
                <p>Scroll up to the table of z-score probabilities again and find the intersection between 1.5 on the left 
                    or right and 3 on the top or bottom, record the value in the cell: <m>0.937</m>.</p>

                <p>That decimal lets us know that 93.7% of values in the set are below the z-score of 1.53. To find the 
                    percentage that is above that value, we subtract 0.937 from 1.0 (or 93.7% from 100%), to get 0.063 or 
                    6.3%.</p>
                
            </solution>
        </example>


        <example><p>What is the probability of a random selection being less than 3.65, given a normal distribution with
            <m>\mu = 5</m> and <m>\sigma = 2.2</m>?</p>
            
            <solution>
                <p>This question requires us to first find the z-score for the value 3.65, then calculate the percentage of 
                    values below that z-score.</p>
                <p>
                <ol label = "1">
                    <li><p>Find the z-score for 3.65, using the z-score formula:</p>
                        <me>z = \frac{3.65 - 5}{2.2} = \frac{-1.35}{2.2}=-0.61</me>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now we can scroll up to our z-score reference above and find the intersection of 0.6 and 0.01, 
                        which should be <m>.7291</m>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since this is a negative z-score, and we want the percentage of values below it, we subtract that 
                        decimal from 1.0 (reference the three steps highlighted by bullet points below the chart if you 
                        didn’t recall this), to get <m>1 - .7291 = .2709</m></li>
                    
                </ol></p>

                <p>There is approximately a 27.09% chance that a value less than 3.65 would occur from a random selection
                    of a normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 2.2.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        
        <p>Returning to the problem,</p>

        <blockquote>Knowing the z-score of a given value is great, but what can you do with it? How does a z-score relate 
            to probability? What is the probability of occurrence of a z-score less than 2.47?</blockquote>

        <p>A z-score lets you calculate the probability that a randomly selected value will be greater or less than a 
            particular value in a set.</p>

        <p>To find the probability of a z-score below +2.47, using a reference such as the table in the lesson above:</p>
        <p>
        <ol label = "1">
            <li>Find 2.4 on the left or right side</li>
            <li>Move across to 0.07 on the top or bottom.</li>
            <li>The cell you arrive at says: <m>0.9932</m>, which means that apx 99.32% of the values in a normal 
                distribution will occur below a z-score of 2.47.</li>

            <p>What percent of the data in a normal distribution has z-score below <m>z = -0.23</m>?</p> 

            <answer><p>This is a negative z-score, and we want the percentage of values greater than it, so we need to 
                subtract the value for z = +0.23 from 1: <m>1 - 0.591 = .409</m>. 40.9% percent of the data in a
                normal distribution have z-scores less than -0.23.</p></answer>
        </problem>
        
        <p>Do z-score probabilities always need to be calculated as the chance of a value either above or below a given 
            score? How would you calculate the probability of a z-score between two values?</p>
        
        <p>To calculate the probability of getting a value with a z-score between two other z-scores, you can use a 
            reference table (such as <xref ref ="normal-zscoretable" />) to look up the value for both scores and 
            subtract them to find the difference.</p>
        
        <example><p>What is the probability associated with a z-score between 1.2 and 2.31?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>To evaluate the probability of a value occurring within a given range, you need to find the probability 
                    of both the upper and lower values in the range, and subtract to find the difference.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>70% of the finishers will be below the top 30%. <m>z = 0.52</m> corresponds 
                    with 0.6985, which is the probability closest to 0.7 in the table.</p>
                <p>Compute the raw score that corresponds with <m>z = 0.52</m>:

    <title>Probability</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>The probability of a specified event is the chance or likelihood that it will occur. There are several ways of viewing probability. One would be experimental in nature, where we repeatedly conduct an experiment. Suppose we flipped a coin over and over and over again and it came up heads about half of the time; we would expect that in the future whenever we flipped the coin it would turn up heads about half of the time. When a weather reporter says “there is a 10% chance of rain tomorrow,” she is basing that on prior evidence; that out of all days with similar weather patterns, it has rained on 1 out of 10 of those days.</p>

<p>Another view would be subjective in nature, in other words an educated guess. If someone asked you the probability that the Seattle Mariners would win their next baseball game, it would be impossible to conduct an experiment where the same two teams played each other repeatedly, each time with the same starting lineup and starting pitchers, each starting at the same time of day on the same field under the precisely the same conditions. Since there are so many variables to take into account, someone familiar with baseball and with the two teams involved might make an educated guess that there is a 75% chance they will win the game; that is, if the same two teams were to play each other repeatedly under identical conditions, the Mariners would win about three out of every four games. But this is just a guess, with no way to verify its accuracy, and depending upon how educated the educated guesser is, a subjective probability may not be worth very much.</p>

<p>We will return to the experimental and subjective probabilities from time to time, but in this course we will mostly be concerned with theoretical probability, which is defined as follows: Suppose there is a situation with <m>n</m> equally likely possible outcomes and that <m>m</m> of those <m>n</m> outcomes correspond to a particular event; then the probability of that event is defined as <m>\frac{n}{m}</m>.</p>

        <p>If you roll a die, pick a card from deck of playing cards, or randomly select a person and observe their hair color, we are executing an experiment or procedure. In probability, we look at the likelihood of different outcomes. We begin with some terminology.</p>

        <note><title>Events and Outcomes</title>
        <p>The result of an experiment is called an <term>outcome</term>.</p>
        <p>An <term>event</term> is any particular outcome or group of outcomes.</p>
        <p>A <term>simple event</term> is an event that cannot be broken down further.</p>
        <p>The <term>sample space</term> is the set of all possible simple events.</p>
    </note>

    <example>
        <p>If we roll a standard 6-sided die, describe the sample space and some simple events.</p>

        <solution><p>The sample space is the set of all possible simple events:  {1,2,3,4,5,6}</p>

        <p>Some examples of simple events:
            <ol label = "a">
        <li>We roll a 1</li>
        <li>We roll a 5</li>
    </ol></p>

<p>Some compound events:
<ol label = "a">
    <li>We roll a number bigger than 4</li>
    <li>We roll an even number</li>
</ol></p>

</solution>
</example>

<definition><title>Basic Probability</title>
<p>Given that all outcomes are equally likely, we can compute the probability of an event <m>E</m>
  using this formula:</p>

  <me>P\left(E\right) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes corresponding to the event E}}{\text{Total number of 
    equally-likely outcomes}}</me>
</definition>

<example>
<p>If we roll a 6-sided die, calculate

<ol label="a">
    <li>P(rolling a 1)</li>
    <li>P(rolling a number bigger than 4)</li>
</ol></p>

<solution>
<p>Recall that the sample space is  {1,2,3,4,5,6}</p>
<p>
<ol label="a">
    <li>There is one outcome corresponding to “rolling a 1”, so the probability is  <m>\frac{1}{6}</m></li>
    <li>There are two outcomes bigger than a 4, so the probability is  <m>\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}</m></li>
</ol></p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>Probabilities are essentially fractions, and can be reduced to lower terms like fractions.</p>

<example>
<p>Let's say you have a bag with 20 cherries, 14 sweet and 6 sour. If you pick a cherry at random, what is the probability that it will be sweet?</p>

<solution>
    <p>There are 20 possible cherries that could be picked, so the number of possible outcomes is 20. Of these 20 possible outcomes, 14 are favorable (sweet), so the probability that the cherry will be sweet is <m>\frac{14}{20}=\frac{7}{10}</m>
</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>There is one potential complication to this example, however. It must be assumed that the probability of picking any of the cherries is the same as the probability of picking any other. This wouldn't be true if (let us imagine) the sweet cherries are smaller than the sour ones. (The sour cherries would come to hand more readily when you sampled from the bag.) Let us keep in mind, therefore, that when we assess probabilities in terms of the ratio of favorable to all potential cases, we rely heavily on the assumption of equal probability for all outcomes.</p>

<note><title>Cards</title>
<p>A standard deck of 52 playing cards consists of four suits (hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs). Spades and clubs are black while hearts and diamonds are red. Each suit contains 13 cards, each of a different rank: an Ace (which in many games functions as both a low card and a high card), cards numbered 2 through 10, a Jack, a Queen and a King.</p>
</note>

<example>
<p>Compute the probability of randomly drawing one card from a deck and getting an Ace.</p>

<solution>
    <p>There are 52 cards in the deck and 4 Aces so</p>
    <me>P = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} \approx .0769</me>
    <p>We can also think of probabilities as percents: There is a 7.69% chance that a randomly selected card will be an 
        Ace.</p>
    </solution>
</example>

<p>Notice that the smallest possible probability is 0 - if there are no outcomes that correspond with the event. The largest possible probability is 1 - if all possible outcomes correspond with the event.</p>

<definition><title>Certain and Impossible events</title>
<p>An <term>impossible event</term> has a probability of 0.</p>

<p>A <term>certain event</term> has a probability of 1.</p>

<p>The probability of any event must be <m>0 \le P\left(E \right) \le 1</m>.
</p>
</definition>

<p>In the course of this chapter, if you compute a probability and get an answer that is negative or greater than 1, you have made a mistake and should check your work.</p>

    <objectives>
            <ul>
                <li>Find probability of complementary events</li>
                <li>Identify independent events</li>

    <title>Working with Events</title>
    <subsection><title>Complementary Events</title>
    <p>Now let us examine the probability that an event does not happen. As in the previous section, consider the situation 
        of rolling a six-sided die and first compute the probability of rolling a six: the answer is <m>P\left( E \right) 
        = \frac{1}{6}</m>. Now consider the probability that we do not roll a six: there are 5 outcomes that are not a six, so the answer is <m>P\left( \text{not } E \right) = \frac{5}{6}</m>. Notice that</p>

        <me>P\left(\text{six}\right) + P\left( \text{not six}\right) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{5}{6} = 1</me>

        <p>This is not a coincidence. Consider a generic situation with <m>n</m> possible outcomes and an event 
        <m>E</m> that corresponds to <m>m</m> of these outcomes. Then the remaining <m>n - m</m> outcomes correspond 
        to <m>E</m> not happening, thus</p>

        <me>P\left( \text{not } E \right) = \frac{n - m}{n} = \frac{n}{n} - \frac{m}{n} = 1 - P\left(E \right)</me>
        
        <definition><title>Complement of an Event</title>
            <p>The complement of an event is the event “E doesn’t happen”</p>

            <p>The notation <m>E^c</m> is used for the complement of event <m>E</m>.</p>

            <p>We can compute the probability of the complement using <m>P\left(E^c\right) = 
                1 - P\left(E\right)</m>.</p>

            <p>Notice also that <m>P\left(E\right)=1-P\left(E^c\right)</m></p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>If you pull a random card from a deck of playing cards, what is the probability it is not a heart?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>There are 13 hearts in the deck, so <m>P\left(\text{heart}\right)=\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}</m>.</p>

                <p>The probability of not drawing a heart is the complement:</p>

                <p><m>P\left(\text{not heart}\right)=1-P\left(\text{heart}\right)=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}</m></p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection><title>Probability of two independent events</title>
<example>
<p>Suppose we flipped a coin and rolled a die, and wanted to know the probability of getting a head on the coin and a 6 on the die.</p>

<solution>
<p>We could list all possible outcomes: {H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6}</p>
<p>Notice there are  <m>2\cdot 6=12</m> total outcomes. Out of these, only 1 is the desired outcome, so the 
probability is <m>\frac{1}{12}</m>.
</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>The prior example was looking at two independent events.</p>

<definition><title>Independent Events</title>
<p>Events A and B are independent events if the probability of Event B occurring is the same whether or not Event A 
    occurs.</p>
</definition>

<example>
<p>Are these events independent?

<ol label = "a">

<li>A fair coin is tossed two times. The two events are (1) first toss is a head and (2) second toss is a head.</li>
<li>The two events (1) "It will rain tomorrow in Houston" and (2) "It will rain tomorrow in Galveston” 
    (a city near Houston).</li>
<li>You draw a card from a deck, then draw a second card without replacing the first.</li>
</ol></p>

<solution>
<p>
    <ol label = "a">
        <li>The probability that a head comes up on the second toss is  <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> regardless of whether 
        or not a head came up on the first toss, so these events are independent.</li>
        <li>These events are not independent because it is more likely that it will rain in Galveston on days it rains 
            in Houston than on days it does not.</li>
        <li>The probability of the second card being red depends on whether the first card is red or not, so these events are not independent.</li>
    </ol></p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events.</p>

<note><title>P(<m>A</m> and <m>B</m>) for Independent Events</title>
<p>If events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent, then the probability of both <m>A</m>
and <m>B</m> occurring is</p>

<me>P\left(A \text{ and } B\right)=P\left(A\right)\cdot P\left(B\right)</me> 

<p>where <m>P\left(A \text{ and } B \right)</m> is the probability of events <m>A</m> and 
<m>B</m> both occurring, <m>P\left(A\right)</m> is the probability of event <m>A</m> occurring, and 
<m>P\left(B \right)</m> is the probability of event <m>B</m> occurring.</p>
</note>

<p>If you look back at the coin and die example from earlier, you can see how the number of outcomes of the first event multiplied by the number of outcomes in the second event multiplied to equal the total number of possible outcomes in the combined event.</p>

<example>
<p>In your drawer you have 10 pairs of socks, 6 of which are white, and 7 tee shirts, 3 of which are white. If you randomly reach in and pull out a pair of socks and a tee shirt, what is the probability both are white?</p>

<solution>
<p>The probability of choosing a white pair of socks is <m>\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}</m>.
<p>The probability of choosing a white tee shirt is <m>\frac{3}{7}</m></p>.
<p>The probability of both being white is  <m>\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{7}=\frac{9}{35}</m></p>
</p>
</solution>
</example>

<problem><title>Try It Now</title>
<p>A card is pulled a deck of cards and noted. The card is then replaced, the deck is shuffled, and a second card is removed and noted. What is the probability that both cards are Aces?</p>
<answer><m>\frac{1}{13} \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{1}{169}</m></answer>
</problem>
        
        <p>The previous examples looked at the probability of both events occurring. Now we will look at the probability of 
            either event occurring.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Suppose we flipped a coin and rolled a die, and wanted to know the probability of getting a head on the coin 
                or a 6 on the die.</p>
            
            <solution>
                <p>Here, there are still 12 possible outcomes: {H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6,T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6}</p>
                <p>By simply counting, we can see that 7 of the outcomes have a head on the coin or a 6 on the die or both - 
                    we use or inclusively here (these 7 outcomes are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, T6), so the probability is
                    <m>\frac{7}{12}</m>. How could we have found this from the individual probabilities?</p>
                
                <p>As we would expect, <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> of these outcomes have a head, and <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> of these 
                    outcomes have a 6 on the die. If we add these, <m>\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} 
                    = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{2}{12} = \frac{8}{12}</m> , which is not the correct 
                    probability.</p>
                
                <p>Looking at the outcomes we can see why: the outcome H6 would have been counted twice, since it contains 
                    both a head and a 6; the probability of both a head and rolling a 6 is <m>\frac{1}{12}</m>. If we 
                    subtract out this double count, we have the correct probability: <m>\frac{8}{12} 
                    - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{7}{12}</m>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
    
        <note><title>P(A or B)</title>
            <p>The probability of either A or B occurring (or both) is</p>
            <me>P\left(A \text{ or } B\right) = P\left(A\right)+P\left(B\right)-P\left(A\text{ and }B\right)</me>
        </note>

        <example>
            <p>Suppose we draw one card from a standard deck. What is the probability that we get a Queen or a King?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>There are 4 Queens and 4 Kings in the deck, hence 8 outcomes corresponding to a Queen or King out of 52 
                    possible outcomes. Thus the probability of drawing a Queen or a King is:</p>

                <p>P(King or Queen) = <m>\frac{8}{52} = \frac{2}{13}</m></p>
                
                <p>Note that in this case, there are no cards that are both a Queen and a King, so P(King and Queen) = 0. 
                    Using our probability rule, we could have said:</p>

                <p><m>P</m>(King or Queen)<m>=P</m>(King)<m>+P</m>(Queen)<m>-P</m>(King and Queen)<m>=
                    \frac{4}{52}+ \frac{4}{52} - 0 = \frac{8}{52}</m></p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>In the last example, the events were mutually exclusive, so P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).</p>

        <example>
            <p>Suppose we draw one card from a standard deck. What is the probability that we get a red card or a King?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Half the cards are red, so <m>P\left(\text{red}\right)=\frac{26}{52}</m></p>
                <p>There are four kings, so <m>P\left(\text{King}\right)=\frac{4}{52}</m></p>
                <p>There are two red kings, so <m>P\left(\text{Red and King}\right)=\frac{2}{52}</m></p>

                <p>We can then calculate</p>
                
                <p><m>P\left(\text{Red or King}\right) = P\left(\text{Red}\right) + P\left(\text{King}\right)
                    - P\left(\text{Red and King}\right) = \frac{26}{52}+\frac{4}{52} - \frac{2}{52}
                    = \frac{28}{52} = \frac{7}{13}</m></p>
            </solution>

                <p>We can see that 15 people of the 665 surveyed had both a red car and got a speeding ticket, so the 
                    probability is <m>\frac{15}{665} \approx 0.0226</m>.</p>

                <p>Notice that having a red car and getting a speeding ticket are not independent events, so the probability 
                    of both of them occurring is not simply the product of probabilities of each one occurring.</p></li>
                    
                    <li>
                    <p>We could answer this question by simply adding up the numbers: 15 people with red cars and speeding 
                        tickets + 135 with red cars but no ticket + 45 with a ticket but no red car = 195 people. So the 
                        probability is <m>\frac{195}{665} \approx 0.2932</m>.</p>

                        <p>We also could have found this probability by:</p>

                        <p>P(had a red car) + P(got a speeding ticket) - P(had a red car and got a speeding 
                            ticket)=<m>\frac{150}{665}+\frac{60}{665}-\frac{15}{665}=\frac{195}{665}</m>.</p>

        <title>Conditional Probability</title>
        <introduction>Often it is required to compute the probability of an event given that another event has 
            occurred.</introduction>
        
        <subsection><title>Conditional Probability</title>

        <example>
            <p>What is the probability that two cards drawn at random from a deck of playing cards will both be aces?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>It might seem that you could use the formula for the probability of two independent events and simply 
                    multiply  <m>\frac{4}{52}\cdot \frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{169}</m>.</p>

                <p>This would be incorrect, however, because the two events are not independent. If the first card drawn 
                    is an ace, then the probability that the second card is also an ace would be lower because there would 
                    only be three aces left in the deck.</p>

                <p>Once the first card chosen is an ace, the probability that the second card chosen is also an ace is 
                    called the conditional probability of drawing an ace. In this case the "condition" is that the first 
                    card is an ace. Symbolically, we write this as:</p>
                
                <p>P(ace on second draw | an ace on the first draw).</p>

                <p>The vertical bar "|" is read as "given," so the above expression is short for "The probability that an 
                    ace is drawn on the second draw given that an ace was drawn on the first draw." What is this  
                    probability? After an ace is drawn on the first draw, there are 3 aces out of 51 total cards left. 
                This means that the conditional probability of drawing an ace after one ace has already been drawn is 
                    <m>\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{17}</m>.</p>

                <p>Thus, the probability of both cards being aces is <m>\frac{4}{52}\cdot \frac{3}{51}=
                    \frac{12}{2652}=\frac{1}{221}</m>.</p>

            <p>This is read as “the probability of B given A”</p>

            <solution>
                <p>These are two independent events, so the probability of the die rolling a 6 is <m>\frac{1}{6}</m>, 
                    regardless of the result of the coin flip.</p>

                <p>The probability that both cards are spades is <m>\frac{13}{52}\cdot\frac{12}{51}=

            <p>If you draw two cards from a deck, what is the probability that you will get the Ace of Diamonds and a 
                black card?</p>
            <solution>
                <p>You can satisfy this condition by having Case A or Case B, as follows:</p>

                <p>Case A) you can get the Ace of Diamonds first and then a black card or</p>

                <p>Case B) you can get a black card first and then the Ace of Diamonds.</p>

                <p>Let's calculate the probability of Case A. The probability that the first card is the Ace of Diamonds 
                    is  <m>|frac{1}{52}</m>. The probability that the second card is black given that the first card is 
                    the Ace of Diamonds is <m>\frac{26}{51}</m> because 26 of the remaining 51 cards are black. The 
                    probability is therefore <m>\frac{1}{52}\cdot \frac{26}{51}=\frac{1}{102}</m>.</p>

                <p>Now for Case B: the probability that the first card is black is <m>\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}</m>. The 
                    probability that the second card is the Ace of Diamonds given that the first card is black is 
                    <m>\frac{1}{51}</m>. The probability of Case B is therefore <m>\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{51}=
                    \frac{1}{102}</m>, the same as the probability of Case 1.</p>

                <p>Recall that the probability of A or B is <m>P\left( A \right) + P\left(B \right) - P\left(
                    A\text{ and }B\right)</m> and n this problem, <m>P\left(A\text{ and }B\right)=0</m> since the first 
                    card cannot be the Ace of Diamonds and be a black card. Therefore, the probability of Case A or Case B 
                    is <m>\frac{1}{102}+\frac{1}{102}=\frac{2}{102}=\frac{1}{51}</m>.</p>
                
                <p>The probability that you will get the Ace of Diamonds and a black card when drawing two cards from a 
                    deck is <m>\frac{1}{51}</m>.</p>

        <subsection><title>Bayes Theorem</title>
            <p>Let's look at more complex conditional probability problems.</p>

            <example>
                <p>Suppose a certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.1% (that is, it afflicts 0.1% of the population). 
                    A test has been devised to detect this disease. The test does not produce false negatives (that is, 
                    anyone who has the disease will test positive for it), but the false positive rate is 5% (that is, 
                    about 5% of people who take the test will test positive, even though they do not have the disease). 
                    Suppose a randomly selected person takes the test and tests positive. What is the probability that 
                    this person actually has the disease?</p>
                
                <solution>
                    <p>There are two ways to approach the solution to this problem. One involves an important result in 
                        probability theory called Bayes' theorem. We will discuss this theorem a bit later, but for now we 
                        will use an alternative and, we hope, much more intuitive approach.</p>

                    <p>Let's break down the information in the problem piece by piece.</p>

                    <p>Suppose a certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.1% (that is, it afflicts 0.1% of the 
                        population). The percentage 0.1% can be converted to a decimal number by moving the decimal place 
                        two places to the left, to get 0.001. In turn, 0.001 can be rewritten as a fraction: 1/1000. This 
                        tells us that about 1 in every 1000 people has the disease. (If we wanted we could write 
                        P(disease)=0.001.)</p>

                    <p>A test has been devised to detect this disease. The test does not produce false negatives (that is, 
                        anyone who has the disease will test positive for it). This part is fairly straightforward: 
                        everyone who has the disease will test positive, or alternatively everyone who tests negative does 
                        not have the disease. (We could also say P(positive | disease)=1.)</p>

                    <p>The false positive rate is 5% (that is, about 5% of people who take the test will test positive, 
                        even though they do not have the disease). This is even more straightforward. Another way of 
                        looking at it is that of every 100 people who are tested and do not have the disease, 5 will test 
                        positive even though they do not have the disease. (We could also say that P(positive | no 
                        disease)=0.05.)</p>

                    <p>Suppose a randomly selected person takes the test and tests positive. What is the probability that 
                        this person actually has the disease? Here we want to compute P(disease|positive). We already know 
                        that P(positive|disease)=1, but remember that conditional probabilities are not equal if the 
                        conditions are switched.</p>

                    <p>Rather than thinking in terms of all these probabilities we have developed, let's create a 
                        hypothetical situation and apply the facts as set out above. First, suppose we randomly select 
                        1000 people and administer the test. How many do we expect to have the disease? Since about 1/1000 
                        of all people are afflicted with the disease, <m>\frac{1}{1000}</m> of 1000 people is 1. (Now you 
                        know why we chose 1000.) Only 1 of 1000 test subjects actually has the disease; the other 999 do 
                        not.</p>
                        

                    <p>We also know that 5% of all people who do not have the disease will test positive. There are 999 
                        disease-free people, so we would expect <m>\left(0.05\right)\left(999\right)=49.95</m> (so, about 
                        50) people to test positive who do not have the disease.</p>

                    <p>Now back to the original question, computing P(disease|positive). There are 51 people who test 
                        positive in our example (the one unfortunate person who actually has the disease, plus the 50 
                        people who tested positive but don't). Only one of these people has the disease, so

                    <me>P\left(\text{disease} | \text{positive}\right) \approx \frac{1}{51} \approx 0.0196</me>

                    or less than 2%. Does this surprise you? This means that of all people who test positive, over 98% do 
                        not have the disease.</p>

                    <p>The answer we got was slightly approximate, since we rounded 49.95 to 50. We could redo the problem 
                        with 100,000 test subjects, 100 of whom would have the disease and <m>\left(0.05\right)
                        \left(99,900\right)=4995</m> test positive but do not have the disease, so the exact probability 
                        of having the disease if you test positive is

                        <me>P\left(\text{disease} | \text{positive}\right) \approx \frac{100}{5095} \approx 0.0196</me>

                        which is pretty much the same answer.</p>
                </solution>
            </example>

            <p>But back to the surprising result. Of all people who test positive, over 98% do not have the disease. If 
                your guess for the probability a person who tests positive has the disease was wildly different from the 
                right answer (2%), don't feel bad. The exact same problem was posed to doctors and medical students at the 
                Harvard Medical School 25 years ago and the results revealed in a 1978 New England Journal of Medicine 
                article. Only about 18% of the participants got the right answer. Most of the rest thought the answer was 
                closer to 95% (perhaps they were misled by the false positive rate of 5%).</p>

            <p>So at least you should feel a little better that a bunch of doctors didn't get the right answer either 
                (assuming you thought the answer was much higher). But the significance of this finding and similar 
                results from other studies in the intervening years lies not in making math students feel better but in 
                the possibly catastrophic consequences it might have for patient care. If a doctor thinks the chances that 
                a positive test result nearly guarantees that a patient has a disease, they might begin an unnecessary and 
                possibly harmful treatment regimen on a healthy patient. Or worse, as in the early days of the AIDS crisis 
                when being HIV-positive was often equated with a death sentence, the patient might take a drastic action 
                and commit suicide.</p>

            <p>As we have seen in this hypothetical example, the most responsible course of action for treating a patient 
                who tests positive would be to counsel the patient that they most likely do not have the disease and to 
                order further, more reliable, tests to verify the diagnosis.</p>

            <p>One of the reasons that the doctors and medical students in the study did so poorly is that such problems, 
                when presented in the types of statistics courses that medical students often take, are solved by use of 
                Bayes' theorem, which is stated as follows.</p>

            <definition><title>Bayes’ Theorem</title>
                <p>Bayes' Theorem is:</p>
                <me>P\left(A|B\right) = \frac{P\left(A\right)\cdot P\left(B|A\right)}{P\left(A\right)\cdot P\left(B|A
                    \right) + P\left(A^c\right) \cdot P\left(B|A^c\right)}</me>
            </definition>

            <p>In our earlier example, this translates to</p>

            <me>P\left(\text{disease} | \text{positive} \right)=\frac{P\left(\text{disease}\right)P\left(\text{positive} | 
                \text{disease} \right)}{P\left(\text{disease} \right)P\left( \text{positive} | \text{disease} \right)
                +P\left( \text{no disease} \right)P\left( \text{positive} | \text{no disease} \right)}</me>

            <p>Plugging in the numbers gives

            <me>P\left(\text{disease} |\text{positive} \right)=\frac{0.001\cdot 1}{0.001 \cdot 1+0.999 \cdot 0.05}
                \approx 0.0196</me>

                which is exactly the same answer as our original solution.</p>

            <p>The problem is that you (or the typical medical student, or even the typical math professor) are much more 
                likely to be able to remember the original solution than to remember Bayes' theorem. Psychologists, such 
                as Gerd Gigerenzer, author of Calculated Risks: How to Know When Numbers Deceive You, have advocated that 
                the method involved in the original solution (which Gigerenzer calls the method of "natural frequencies") 
                be employed in place of Bayes' Theorem. Gigerenzer performed a study and found that those educated in the 
                natural frequency method were able to recall it far longer than those who were taught Bayes' theorem. When 
                one considers the possible life-and-death consequences associated with such calculations it seems wise to 
                heed his advice.</p>

            <example>
                <p>A certain disease has an incidence rate of 2%. If the false negative rate is 10% and the false positive 
                    rate is 1%, compute the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease.</p>

                <solution>
                    <p>Imagine 10,000 people who are tested. Of these 10,000, 200 will have the disease; 10% of them, or 
                        20, will test negative and the remaining 180 will test positive. Of the 9800 who do not have the 
                        disease, 98 will test positive. So of the 278 total people who test positive, 180 will have the 
                        disease. Thus
                        
                        <me>P\left(\text{disease} | \text{positive} \right)=\frac{180}{278} \approx 0.647</me>


                        so about 65% of the people who test positive will have the disease.</p>

                    <p>Using Bayes theorem directly would give the same result:

                    <me>P\left( \text{disease} | \text{positive} \right)=\frac{0.02\cdot 0.90}{0.02\cdot 0.90+0.98 \cdot  
                        0.01}=\frac{0.018}{0.0278} \approx 0.647</me>
                    </p>
                    
                </solution>
            </example>

            <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                <p>A certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.5%. If there are no false negatives and if the false 
                    positive rate is 3%, compute the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the 
                    disease.</p>
                
                <answer><p>Out of 100,000 people, 500 would have the disease. Of those, all 500 would test positive. Of 
                    the 99,500 without the disease, 2,985 would falsely test positive and the other 96,515 would test 
                    negative.</p>

                    <p>P(disease|positive)=<m>\frac{500}{500+2985}=\frac{500}{3485}\approx 14.3\%</m></p>

        <title>Probability using Permutations and Combinations</title>
        
        <objectives>
            <ul>
                <li>Use permutations and combinations to calculate probabilities</li>
            </ul>
        </objectives>

        <p>We can use permutations and combinations to help us answer more complex probability questions.</p>

        <example>
            <p>A 4 digit PIN number is selected. What is the probability that there are no repeated digits?</p>
            <solution>
                <p>There are 10 possible values for each digit of the PIN (namely: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), so there are 
                    <m>10\cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10=10^4=10000</m> total possible PIN numbers.</p>

                <p>To have no repeated digits, all four digits would have to be different, which is selecting without 
                    replacement. We could either compute <m>10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7</m>, or notice that this is the 
                    same as the permutation <m>_{10}P_{4}=5040</m>.</p>

                <p>The probability of no repeated digits is the number of 4 digit PIN numbers with no repeated digits 
                    divided by the total number of 4 digit PIN numbers. This probability is <m>\frac{_{10}P_{4}}{10^4}=
                    \frac{5040}{10000}=0.504</m>.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>In a certain state's lottery, 48 balls numbered 1 through 48 are placed in a machine and six of them are 
                drawn at random. If the six numbers drawn match the numbers that a player had chosen, the player wins 
                $1,000,000. In this lottery, the order the numbers are drawn in doesn’t matter. Compute the probability 
                that you win the million-dollar prize if you purchase a single lottery ticket.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>In order to compute the probability, we need to count the total number of ways six numbers can be 
                    drawn, and the number of ways the six numbers on the player’s ticket could match the six numbers 
                    drawn from the machine. Since there is no stipulation that the numbers be in any particular order, 
                    the number of possible outcomes of the lottery drawing is <m>_{48}C_{6}=12,271,512</m>. Of these 
                    possible outcomes, only one would match all six numbers on the player’s ticket, so the probability of 
                    winning the grand prize is:

                    <me>\frac{_{6}C_{6}}{_{48}C_{6}}=\frac{1}{12271512}\approx 0.0000000815</me>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <p>In the state lottery from the previous example, if five of the six numbers drawn match the numbers that a 
                player has chosen, the player wins a second prize of $1,000. Compute the probability that you win the 
                second prize if you purchase a single lottery ticket.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>As above, the number of possible outcomes of the lottery drawing is <m>_{48}C_{6}=12,271,512</m>. In 
                    order to win the second prize, five of the six numbers on the ticket must match five of the six 
                    winning numbers; in other words, we must have chosen five of the six winning numbers and one of the 
                    42 losing numbers. The number of ways to choose 5 out of the 6 winning numbers is given by 
                    <m>_{6}C_{5}=6</m> and the number of ways to choose 1 out of the 42 losing numbers is given by 
                    <m>_{42}C_{1}=42</m>. Thus the number of favorable outcomes is then given by the Basic Counting Rule: 
                    <m>_{6}C_{5}\cdot _{42}C_{1}=6\cdot 42=252</m>.</p>
                <p>So the probability of winning the second prize is <m>\frac{252}{12271512} \approx 0.0000205</m></p>
            </solution>

        </problem>

        <example>
            <p>Compute the probability of randomly drawing five cards from a deck and getting exactly one Ace.</p>
            
            <solution>
                <p>In many card games (such as poker) the order in which the cards are drawn is not important (since the 
                    player may rearrange the cards in his hand any way he chooses); in the problems that follow, we will 
                    assume that this is the case unless otherwise stated. Thus we use combinations to compute the possible 
                    number of 5-card hands, <m>_{52}C_{5}</m>. This number will go in the denominator of our probability 
                    formula, since it is the number of possible outcomes.</p>

                <p>For the numerator, we need the number of ways to draw one Ace and four other cards (none of them Aces) 
                    from the deck. Since there are four Aces and we want exactly one of them, there will be 
                    <m>_{4}C_{1}</m> ways to select one Ace; since there are 48 non-Aces and we want 4 of them, there will 
                    be <m>_{48}C_{4}</m> ways to select the four non-Aces. Now we use the Basic Counting Rule to calculate that there will be <m>_{4}C_{1}\cdot _{48}C_{4}</m> ways to choose one ace and four non-Aces.</p>

                <p>Putting this all together, we have P(one Ace)<m>=\frac{_{4}C_{1} \cdot _{48}C_{4}}
                    {_{52}C_{5}}=\frac{778320}{2598960} \approx 0.299</m></p>

        <example>
            <p>Compute the probability of randomly drawing five cards from a deck and getting exactly two Aces.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>The solution is similar to the previous example, except now we are choosing 2 Aces out of 4 and 3 non-
                    Aces out of 48; the denominator remains the same:</p>

                <p>P(two Aces)=<m>\frac{_{4}C_{2}\cdot _{48}C_{3}}{_{52}C_{5}}=\frac{103776}{2598960}

        <p>Let's take a pause to consider a famous problem in probability theory:</p>

        <p>Suppose you have a room full of 30 people. What is the probability that there is at least one shared 
            birthday?</p>

        <p>Take a guess at the answer to the above problem. Was your guess fairly low, like around 10%? That seems to be 
            the intuitive answer (<m>\frac{30}{365}</m>, perhaps?). Let's see if we should listen to our intuition. Let's 
            start with a simpler problem, however.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Suppose three people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday 
                among these three people?</p>
            
            <solution>
                <p>There are a lot of ways there could be at least one shared birthday. Fortunately there is an easier 
                    way. We ask ourselves “What is the alternative to having at least one shared birthday?” In this case, 
                    the alternative is that there are no shared birthdays. In other words, the alternative to “at least 
                    one” is having none. In other words, since this is a complementary event,</p>

                <p>P(at least one)=1-P(none)</p>

                <p>We will start, then, by computing the probability that there is no shared birthday. Let's imagine that 
                    you are one of these three people. Your birthday can be anything without conflict, so there are 365 
                    choices out of 365 for your birthday. What is the probability that the second person does not share 
                    your birthday? There are 365 days in the year (let's ignore leap years) and removing your birthday 
                    from contention, there are 364 choices that will guarantee that you do not share a birthday with this 
                    person, so the probability that the second person does not share your birthday is 
                    <m>\frac{364}{365}</m>.</p>
                
                <p>Now we move to the third person. What is the probability that this third person does not have the same 
                    birthday as either you or the second person? There are 363 days that will not duplicate your birthday 
                    or the second person's, so the probability that the third person does not share a birthday with the 
                    first two is <m>\frac{363}{365}</m>.</p>

                <p>We want the second person not to share a birthday with you and the third person not to share a 
                    birthday with the first two people, so we use the multiplication rule:</p>

                <p>P(no shared birthday)=<m>\frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \cdot \frac{363}{365} \approx 
                    0.9918</m></p>

                <p>and then subtract from 1 to get</p>

                <p>P(shared birthday)= 1 - P(no shared birthday)=<m>1-0.9918=0.0082</m>.</p>

                <p>This is a pretty small number, so maybe it makes sense that the answer to our original problem will be 
                    small. Let's make our group a bit bigger.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>Suppose five people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday 
                among these five people?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Continuing the pattern of the previous example, the answer should be</p>

                <p>P(shared birthday)=<m>1-\frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \cdot \frac{363}{365}
                    \cdot \frac{362}{365}\cdot \frac{361}{365} \approx 0.0271</m></p>

                <p>Note that we could rewrite this more compactly as P(shared birthday)=
                    <m>1-\frac{_{365}P_{5}}{365^5}\approx 0.0271</m> which makes it a bit easier to type into a 
                    calculator or computer, and which suggests a nice formula as we continue to expand the population of 
                    our group.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        

        <example>
            <p>Suppose 30 people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday among 
                these 30 people?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Here we can calculate P(shared birthday)=<m>1-\frac{_{365}P_{30}}{365^{30}} \approx 0.706</m></p>

                <p>which gives us the surprising result that when you are in a room with 30 people there is a 70% chance 
                    that there will be at least one shared birthday!</p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>If you like to bet, and if you can convince 30 people to reveal their birthdays, you might be able to win some 
            money by betting a friend that there will be at least two people with the same birthday in the room anytime 
            you are in a room of 30 or more people. (Of course, you would need to make sure your friend hasn't studied 
            probability!) You wouldn't be guaranteed to win, but you should win more than half the time.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Compute expected values</li>
            </ul>
        </objectives>
        
        <p>Expected value is perhaps the most useful probability concept we will discuss.  It has many 
applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's one thing that the 
casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries hope most 
            people never learn about.  </p>
 
 
<example>
    <p>In the casino game roulette, a wheel with 38 spaces (18 red, 18 
    black, and 2 green) is spun.  In one possible bet, the player bets 
    $1 on a single number.  If that number is spun on the wheel, then 
    they receive $36 (their original $1 + $35).  Otherwise, they lose 
    their $1.  On average, how much money should a player expect to 
        win or lose if they play this game repeatedly? </p>
 
    <solution>
        <p>Suppose you bet $1 on each of the 38 spaces on the wheel, for a 
    total of $38 bet.  When the winning number is spun, you are paid $36 on that number.  While 
    you won on that one number, overall you’ve lost $2.  On a per-space basis, you have “won” -
            $2/$38 = -$0.053.  In other words, on average you lose 5.3 cents per space you bet on. </p>
    </solution>
        </example>
 
 <p>We call this average gain or loss the expected value of playing roulette.  Notice that no one 
ever loses exactly 5.3 cents: most people (in fact, about 37 out of every 38) lose $1 and a 
very few people (about 1 person out of every 38) gain $35 (the $36 they win minus the $1 
     they spent to play the game). </p>
 
<p>There is another way to compute expected value without imagining what would happen if we 
play every possible space.  There are 38 possible outcomes when the wheel spins, so the 
    probability of winning is <m>\frac{1}{38}</m>. The complement, the probability of losing, is <m>\frac{37}{38}</m>.</p>  
 
        <p>Summarizing these along with the values, we get this table: </p>

                <p>On average, one can expect to lose about 90 cents on a lottery ticket. Of course, most players will

            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>In general, if the expected value of a game is negative, it is not a good idea to play the game, since on 
            average you will lose money. It would be better to play a game with a positive expected value (good luck 
            trying to find one!), although keep in mind that even if the average winnings are positive it could be the 
            case that most people lose money and one very fortunate individual wins a great deal of money. If the 
            expected value of a game is 0, we call it a fair game, since neither side has an advantage.</p>

        <p>Not surprisingly, the expected value for casino games is negative for the player, which is positive for the 
            casino. It must be positive or they would go out of business. Players just need to keep in mind that when 
            they play a game repeatedly, their expected value is negative. That is fine so long as you enjoy playing the 
            game and think it is worth the cost. But it would be wrong to expect to come out ahead.</p>

            <p>A friend offers to play a game, in which you roll 3 standard 6-sided dice. If all the dice roll different 
                values, you give him $1. If any two dice match values, you get $2. What is the expected value of this 
                game? Would you play?</p>
            <answer><p>
                Suppose you roll the first die. The probability the second will be different is <m>\frac{5}{6}</m>. 
                The probability that 
                the third roll is different than the previous two is <m>\frac{4}{6}</m>, so the probability that the 
                three dice are 
                different is <m>\frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{4}{6}=\frac{20}{36}</m>. The probability that two dice will match

                <p>The expected value is: <m>\$2 \cdot \frac{16}{36}+\left(-\$1 \right) \cdot \frac{20}{36}
                    =\frac{12}{36} \approx \$0.33</m>.</p>

        <p>Expected value also has applications outside of gambling. Expected value is very common in making insurance 
            decisions.</p>

        <example>
            <p>A 40-year-old man in the U.S. has a 0.242% risk of dying during the next year. An insurance company 
                charges $275 for a life-insurance policy that pays a $100,000 death benefit. What is the expected value for 
                the person buying the insurance?</p>

            </solution>
        </example>
                
        <p>Not surprisingly, the expected value is negative; the insurance company can only afford to offer policies if 
            they, on average, make money on each policy. They can afford to pay out the occasional benefit because they 
            offer enough policies that those benefit payouts are balanced by the rest of the insured people.</p>

        <p>For people buying the insurance, there is a negative expected value, but there is a security that comes from 
            insurance that is worth that cost.</p>

                <p>If we roll a regular six-sided die twice, what is the probability that both rolls will and as even numbers?</p>
            </statement>

            <solution>
                <p>Each roll is independent. The probability of the first roll showing an even number is:

                    <me>P\left(even\right) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}</me>
                    The probability of the 2nd roll showing an even number is also <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.</p>

                <p>So the probability of both die showing even numbers is:

                    <me>P\left(E\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}</me>

                <p>The probability of the first pitch being a ball is, P(ball) = 0.3.</p>
                <p>Each pitch is an independent event, so the probability of all five being balls is:

                    <me>P\left(E\right) = 0.3 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.3 = (0.3)^5 = 0.00243</me>

                    person who tests positive actually has the disease?</p>

            <solution>
                <p>We can use Bayes theorem or a tree to solve this one.</p>
                <p>Suppose we start with a population of 1,000 people.  Then <m>0.01\left(1000\right) = 10</m> people have the 
                    disease.  The other 990 do not have the disease.</p>
                <p>Since the test is 97% accurate, of the 10 people who have the disease:
                    <ul>
                        <li>0.97(10) = 9.7 will test positive</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Considering the 990 who do not have the disease:
                    <ul>
                        <li>0.97(990) = 960.3 will test negative</li>
                        <li>0.03(990) = 29.7 will test positive</li>

                </p>
                <p>There will be a total of 29.7 + 9.7 = 39.4 positive tests.  Only 9.7 of those actually have the disease.  Given 
                    that a person tests positive, the probability of having the disease is:

                    <me>P\left(E\right) = \frac{9.7}{39.4} = 0.246</me>

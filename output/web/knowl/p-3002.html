<li><div class="para">Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the <dfn class="terminology">divisor</dfn>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the <dfn class="terminology">quota</dfn>. Since we can only allocate whole representatives, Hamilton resolves the whole number problem, as follows:</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don’t forget what the decimals were). These are called the <dfn class="terminology">lower quotas</dfn>. Add up the remaining whole numbers. This answer will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives (and the “or equal to” part happens only in very specific circumstances that are incredibly unlikely to turn up).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Assuming that the total from the previous step was less than the total number of representatives, assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states whose decimal parts of the quota were largest, until the desired total is reached.</div></li>

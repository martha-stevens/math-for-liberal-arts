<div class="para">There are two approaches we could take to this problem: 1) estimate the number of boards we will need and find the cost per board, or 2) estimate the area of the deck and find the approximate cost per square foot for deck boards. We will take the latter approach.</div> <div class="para">For this solution pathway, we will be able to answer the question if we know the cost per square foot for decking boards and the square footage of the deck. To find the cost per square foot for decking boards, we could compute the area of a single board, and divide it into the cost for that board. We can compute the square footage of the deck using geometric formulas. So first we need information: the dimensions of the deck, and the cost and dimensions of a single deck board.</div> <div class="para">Suppose that measuring the deck, it is rectangular, measuring 16 ft by 24 ft, for a total area of <span class="process-math">\(384\text{ ft}^2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">From a visit to the local home store, you find that an 8 foot by 4 inch cedar deck board costs about $7.50. The area of this board, doing the necessary conversion from inches to feet, is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
8 \text{ feet}\cdot 4 \text{ inches}\cdot \frac{1\text{ foot}}{12\text{ inches}}=2.667\text{ ft}^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The cost per square foot is then <span class="process-math">\(\$7.50 \div 2.667\text{ ft}^2=\$2.8125\)</span> per square foot.</div> <div class="para">This will allow us to estimate the material cost for the whole 384 square foot deck.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\$384 \text{ ft}^2 \cdot \frac{\$2.8125}{\text{ ft}^2}=\$1080
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Of course, this cost estimate assumes that there is no waste, which is rarely the case. It is common to add at least 10% to the cost estimate to account for waste.</div>

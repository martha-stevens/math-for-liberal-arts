  "title": "Percents",
  "body": " Percents    Solve percent problems, including percent increase and decrease.  Solve applications using percentages such as budgets, sales tax and discounts.  Compute relative and absolute change.    In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered \"90% of the coalition casualties\" in Iraq. Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security forces and coalition allies \"have taken almost 50 percent\" of the casualties. Who is correct? How can we make sense of these numbers?  Percent literally means “per 100,” or “parts per hundred.” When we write 40%, this is equivalent to the fraction or the decimal 0.40. Notice that 80 out of 200 and 10 out of 25 are also 40%, since   243 people out of 400 state that they like dogs. What percent is this?    This is 60.75%.  Notice that the percent can be found from the equivalent decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the right.     Write each as a percent:                 Percents  If we have a part that is some percent of a whole, then or equivalently, To do the calculations, we write the percent as a decimal.    The sales tax in a town is 9.4%. How much tax will you pay on a $140 purchase?   Here, $140 is the whole, and we want to find 9.4% of $140. We start by writing the percent as a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left (which is equivalent to dividing by 100).  We can then compute: The tax is $13.16     In the news, you hear “tuition is expected to increase by 7% next year.” If tuition this year was $1200 per quarter, what will it be next year?   The tuition next year will be the current tuition plus an additional 7%, so it will be 107% of this year’s tuition: The tuition will be $1,284.  Alternatively, we could have first calculated 7% of $1200: Notice this is not the expected tuition for next year (we could only wish). Instead, this is the expected increase, so to calculate the expected tuition, we’ll need to add this change to the previous year’s tuition: Again, we get a tuition of $1,284.    Try It Now  A TV originally priced at $799 is on sale for 30% off. There is then a 9.2% sales tax. Find the price after including the discount and sales tax.  $799(0.70) = $559.30  $559.30(1.092) = $610.76   The value of a car dropped from $7400 to $6800 over the last year. What percent decrease is this?   To compute the percent change, we first need to find the dollar value change: Often we will take the absolute value of this amount, which is called the absolute change : Since we are computing the decrease relative to the starting value, we compute this percent out of $7400: The value decreased by 8.1%. This is called a relative change .     Absolute and Relative Change  Given two quantities,    Absolute change has the same units as the original quantity.  Relative change gives a percent change.  The starting quantity is called the base of the percent change.   The base of a percent is very important. For example, while Nixon was president, it was argued that marijuana was a “gateway” drug, claiming that 80% of marijuana smokers went on to use harder drugs like cocaine. The problem is, this isn’t true. The true claim is that 80% of harder drug users first smoked marijuana. The difference is one of base: 80% of marijuana smokers using hard drugs, vs. 80% of hard drug users having smoked marijuana. These numbers are not equivalent. As it turns out, only one in 2,400 marijuana users actually go on to use harder drugs.   There are about 75 QFC supermarkets in the U.S. Albertsons has about 215 stores. Compare the size of the two companies.   When we make comparisons, we must ask first whether an absolute or relative comparison. The absolute difference is . From this, we could say “Albertsons has 140 more stores than QFC.” However, if you wrote this in an article or paper, that number does not mean much. The relative difference may be more meaningful. There are two different relative changes we could calculate, depending on which store we use as the base:  Using QFC as the base, This tells us Albertsons is 186.7% larger than QFC.  Using Albertsons as the base, This tells us QFC is 65.1% smaller than Albertsons.  Notice both of these are showing percent differences. We could also calculate the size of Albertsons relative to QFC: which tells us Albertsons is 2.867 times the size of QFC. Likewise, we could calculate the size of QFC relative to Albertsons: which tells us that QFC is 34.9% of the size of Albertsons.     Suppose a stock drops in value by 60% one week, then increases in value the next week by 75%. Is the value higher or lower than where it started?   To answer this question, suppose the value started at $100. After one week, the value dropped by 60%: In the next week, notice that base of the percent has changed to the new value, $40.  Computing the 75% increase: In the end, the stock is still $30 lower, or $30 $100 = 30% lower, valued than it started.    Try It Now  The U.S. federal debt at the end of 2001 was $5.77 trillion, and grew to $6.20 trillion by the end of 2002. At the end of 2005 it was $7.91 trillion, and grew to $8.45 trillion by the end of 2006. Calculate the absolute and relative increase for 2001-2002 and 2005-2006. Which year saw a larger increase in federal debt?   2001-2002: Absolute change: $0.43 trillion. Relative change: 7.45%  2005-2006: Absolute change: $0.54 trillion. Relative change: 6.83%  2005-2006 saw a larger absolute increase, but a smaller relative increase.    A Seattle Times article on high school graduation rates reported “The number of schools graduating 60 percent or fewer students in four years - sometimes referred to as “dropout factories” - decreased by 17 during that time period. The number of kids attending schools with such low graduation rates was cut in half.”    Is the “decrease by 17” number a useful comparison?  Considering the last sentence, can we conclude that the number of “dropout factories” was originally 34?         This number is hard to evaluate, since we have no basis for judging whether this is a larger or small change. If the number of “dropout factories” dropped from 20 to 3, that’d be a very significant change, but if the number dropped from 217 to 200, that’d be less of an improvement.   The last sentence provides relative change which helps put the first sentence in perspective. We can estimate that the number of “dropout factories” was probably previously around 34. However, it’s possible that students simply moved schools rather than the school improving, so that estimate might not be fully accurate.       In the 2004 vice-presidential debates, Edwards's claimed that US forces have suffered \"90% of the coalition casualties\" in Iraq. Cheney disputed this, saying that in fact Iraqi security forces and coalition allies \"have taken almost 50 percent\" of the casualties. Who is correct?   Without more information, it is hard for us to judge who is correct, but we can easily conclude that these two percents are talking about different things, so one does not necessarily contradict the other. Edward’s claim was a percent with coalition forces as the base of the percent, while Cheney’s claim was a percent with both coalition and Iraqi security forces as the base of the percent. It turns out both statistics are in fact fairly accurate.    We’ll wrap up our review of percents with a couple cautions. First, when talking about a change of quantities that are already measured in percents, we have to be careful in how we describe the change.  A politician’s support increases from 40% of voters to 50% of voters. Describe the change.   We could describe this using an absolute change: Notice that since the original quantities were percents, this change also has the units of percent.  In this case, it is best to describe this as an increase of 10 percentage points.  In contrast, we could compute the percent change: This is the relative change, and we’d say the politician’s support has increased by 25%.    Lastly, a caution against averaging percents.  A basketball player scores on 40% of 2-point field goal attempts, and on 30% of 3-point of field goal attempts. Find the player’s overall field goal percentage.   It is very tempting to average these values, and claim the overall average is 35%, but this is likely not correct, since most players make many more 2-point attempts than 3-point attempts.  We don’t actually have enough information to answer the question.Suppose the player attempted 200 2-point field goals and 100 3-point field goals. Then they made 2-point shots and 3-point shots. Overall, they made 110 shots out of 300, for a 36.7% overall field goal percentage.    "

  "body": "Proportions and Rates    Compute rates and unit rates  Solve applications with proportions  Perform unit conversions    If you wanted to power the city of Seattle using wind power, how many windmills would you need to install? Questions like these can be answered using rates and proportions.  Rates  A rate is the ratio (fraction) of two quantities.  A unit rate is a rate with a denominator of one.    Your car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 15 gallons. Express this as a rate.   Expressed as a rate,  We can divide to find a unit rate:     Proportion Equation  A proportion equation is an equation showing the equivalence of two rates or ratios.   The cross products of a proportion will be equation; that is,    A map scale indicates that inch on the map corresponds with 3 real miles. How many miles apart are two cities that are inches apart on the map?   We can set up a proportion by setting equal two rates, and introducing a variable, , to represent the unknown quantity - the mile distance between the cities.   Then we can set the cross products equal to solve:     Finally, we can divide both sides by to solve for . Recall, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. For example,  To solve for x, when can divide both sides by , which is equivalent to multiplying both sides by 2.      Many proportion problems can also be solved using dimensional analysis, the process of multiplying a quantity by rates to change the units.   Your car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 15 gallons. How far can it drive on 40 gallons?   We could certainly answer this question using a proportion:   However, we earlier found that 300 miles on 15 gallons gives a rate of 20 miles per gallon. If we multiply the given 40 gallon quantity by this rate, the gallons unit “cancels” and we’re left with a number of miles:   Notice if instead we were asked “how many gallons are needed to drive 50 miles?” we could answer this question by inverting the 20 mile per gallon rate so that the miles unit cancels and we’re left with gallons:     Dimensional analysis can also be used to do unit conversions. Here are some unit conversions for reference.  Unit Conversions  Some common unit conversions for length are:  1 foot (ft) = 12 inches (in)  1 yard (yd) = 3 feet (ft)  1 mile = 5,280 feet  1000 millimeters (mm) = 1 meter (m)  100 centimeters (cm) = 1 meter  1000 meters (m) = 1 kilometer (km)  2.54 centimeters (cm) = 1 inch    Some common unit conversions for weight and mass are:  1 pound (lb) = 16 ounces (oz)  1 ton = 2000 pounds  1000 milligrams (mg) = 1 gram (g)  1000 grams = 1kilogram (kg)  1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds (on earth)    Some common unit conversions for capacity are:  1 cup = 8 fluid ounces (fl oz)  1 pint = 2 cups  1 quart = 2 pints = 4 cups  1 gallon = 4 quarts = 16 cups  1000 milliliters (ml) = 1 liter (L)      A bicycle is traveling at 15 miles per hour. How many feet will it cover in 20 seconds?   To answer this question, we need to convert 20 seconds into feet. If we know the speed of the bicycle in feet per second, this question would be simpler. Since we don’t, we will need to do additional unit conversions. We will need to know that 5280 ft = 1 mile. We might start by converting the 20 seconds into hours:   Now we can multiply by 15 miles\/hour to get miles:   Now we convert to feet:   We could have also done this in one step:     Try It Now  A 1000 foot spool of bare 12-gauge copper wire weighs 19.8 pounds. How much will 18 inches of the wire weigh, in ounces?  0.475 ounces   Notice that with the miles per gallon example, if we double the miles driven, we double the gas used. Likewise, with the map distance example, if the map distance doubles, the real-life distance doubles. This is a key feature of proportional relationships, and one we must confirm before assuming two things are related proportionally.   Suppose you’re tiling the floor of a 10 ft by 10 ft room, and find that 100 tiles will be needed. How many tiles will be needed to tile the floor of a 20 ft by 20 ft room?   In this case, while the width the room has doubled, the area has quadrupled. Since the number of tiles needed corresponds with the area of the floor, not the width, 400 tiles will be needed. We could find this using a proportion based on the areas of the rooms:     Other quantities just don’t scale proportionally at all.  Suppose a small company spends $1000 on an advertising campaign, and gains 100 new customers from it. How many new customers should they expect if they spend $10,000?   While it is tempting to say that they will gain 1000 new customers, it is likely that additional advertising will be less effective than the initial advertising. For example, if the company is a hot tub store, there are likely only a fixed number of people interested in buying a hot tub, so there might not even be 1000 people in the town who would be potential customers.    Sometimes when working with rates, proportions, and percents, the process can be made more challenging by the magnitude of the numbers involved. Sometimes, large numbers are just difficult to comprehend.   Compare the 2010 U.S. military budget of $683.7 billion to other quantities.   Here we have a very large number, about $683,700,000,000 written out. Of course, imagining a billion dollars is very difficult, so it can help to compare it to other quantities.  If that amount of money was used to pay the salaries of the 1.4 million Walmart employees in the U.S., each would earn over $488,000.  There are about 300 million people in the U.S. The military budget is about $2,200 per person.  If you were to put $683.7 billion in $100 bills, and count out 1 per second, it would take 216 years to finish counting it.     Compare the electricity consumption per capita in China to the rate in Japan.   To address this question, we will first need data. From the CIA website we can find the electricity consumption in 2011 for China was 4,693,000,000,000 KWH (kilowatt-hours), or 4.693 trillion KWH, while the consumption for Japan was 859,700,000,000, or 859.7 billion KWH. To find the rate per capita (per person), we will also need the population of the two countries. From the World Bank, we can find the population of China is 1,344,130,000, or 1.344 billion, and the population of Japan is 127,817,277, or 127.8 million.  Computing the consumption per capita for each country:  China: KWH per person  Japan: KWH per person  While China uses more than 5 times the electricity of Japan overall, because the population of Japan is so much smaller, it turns out Japan uses almost twice the electricity per person compared to China.

We’ll use one based on triangles, which requires that it’s a sunny day. Suppose the tree is casting a shadow, say 15 ft long. I can then have a friend help me measure my own shadow. Suppose I am 6 ft tall, and cast a 1.5 ft shadow.

In other words, the ratio of height to width will be the same in both triangles. Using this, we can find the height of the tree, which we’ll denote by h.   Multiplying both sides by 15, we get h = 60. The tree is about 60 ft tall.    It may be helpful to recall some formulas for areas and volumes of a few basic shapes.

To answer this question, we need to consider how the weight of the dough will scale. The weight will be based on the volume of the dough. However, since both pizzas will be about the same thickness, the weight will scale with the area of the top of the pizza. We can find the area of each pizza using the formula for area of a circle, :  A 12” pizza has radius 6 inches, so the area will be = about 113 square inches.  A 16” pizza has radius 8 inches, so the area will be = about 201 square inches.  Notice that if both pizzas were 1 inch thick, the volumes would be 113 in and 201 respectively, which are at the same ratio as the areas. As mentioned earlier, since the thickness is the same for both pizzas, we can safely ignore it  We can now set up a proportion to find the weight of the dough for a 16” pizza:   Multiply both sides by 201  = about 17.8 ounces of dough for a 16” pizza.  It is interesting to note that while the diameter is times larger, the dough required, which scales with area, is times larger.    A company makes regular and jumbo marshmallows.

In many problems, it is tempting to take the given information, plug it into whatever formulas you have handy, and hope that the result is what you were supposed to find. Chances are, this approach has served you well in other math classes.  This approach does not work well with real life problems. Instead, problem solving is best approached by first starting at the end: identifying exactly what you are looking for. From there, you then work backwards, asking “what information and procedures will I need to find this?” Very few interesting questions can be answered in one mathematical step; often times you will need to chain together a solution pathway, a series of steps that will allow you to answer the question.  Problem Solving Process    Identify the question you’re trying to answer.  Work backwards, identifying the information you will need and the relationships you will use to answer that question.  Continue working backwards, creating a solution pathway.  If you are missing necessary information, look it up or estimate it. If you have unnecessary information, ignore it.  Solve the problem, following your solution pathway.     In most problems we work, we will be approximating a solution, because we will not have perfect information. We will begin with a few examples where we will be able to approximate the solution using basic knowledge from our lives.  How many times does your heart beat in a year?   This question is asking for the rate of heart beats per year. Since a year is a long time to measure heart beats for, if we knew the rate of heart beats per minute, we could scale that quantity up to a year. So the information we need to answer this question is heart beats per minute. This is something you can easily measure by counting your pulse while watching a clock for a minute.  Suppose you count 80 beats in a minute. To convert this beats per year:      How thick is a single sheet of paper? How much does it weigh?   While you might have a sheet of paper handy, trying to measure it would be tricky. Instead we might imagine a stack of paper, and then scale the thickness and weight to a single sheet. If you’ve ever bought paper for a printer or copier, you probably bought a ream, which contains 500 sheets. We could estimate that a ream of paper is about 2 inches thick and weighs about 5 pounds. Scaling these down,  inches per sheet  pounds per sheet, or 0.16 ounces per sheet.     A recipe for zucchini muffins states that it yields 12 muffins, with 250 calories per muffin. You instead decide to make mini-muffins, and the recipe yields 20 muffins. If you eat 4, how many calories will you consume?   There are several possible solution pathways to answer this question. We will explore one.  To answer the question of how many calories 4 mini-muffins will contain, we would want to know the number of calories in each mini-muffin. To find the calories in each mini-muffin, we could first find the total calories for the entire recipe, then divide it by the number of mini-muffins produced. To find the total calories for the recipe, we could multiply the calories per standard muffin by the number per muffin. Notice that this produces a multi-step solution pathway. It is often easier to solve a problem in small steps, rather than trying to find a way to jump directly from the given information to the solution.  We can now execute our plan:  calories for the whole recipe.  calories per mini-muffin.  calories consumed.     You need to replace the boards on your deck. About how much will the materials cost?   There are two approaches we could take to this problem: 1) estimate the number of boards we will need and find the cost per board, or 2) estimate the area of the deck and find the approximate cost per square foot for deck boards. We will take the latter approach.  For this solution pathway, we will be able to answer the question if we know the cost per square foot for decking boards and the square footage of the deck. To find the cost per square foot for decking boards, we could compute the area of a single board, and divide it into the cost for that board. We can compute the square footage of the deck using geometric formulas. So first we need information: the dimensions of the deck, and the cost and dimensions of a single deck board.  Suppose that measuring the deck, it is rectangular, measuring 16 ft by 24 ft, for a total area of .  From a visit to the local home store, you find that an 8 foot by 4 inch cedar deck board costs about $7.50. The area of this board, doing the necessary conversion from inches to feet, is:   The cost per square foot is then per square foot.  This will allow us to estimate the material cost for the whole 384 square foot deck.   Of course, this cost estimate assumes that there is no waste, which is rarely the case. It is common to add at least 10% to the cost estimate to account for waste.     Is it worth buying a Hyundai Sonata hybrid instead the regular Hyundai Sonata?   To make this decision, we must first decide what our basis for comparison will be. For the purposes of this example, we’ll focus on fuel and purchase costs, but environmental impacts and maintenance costs are other factors a buyer might consider.  It might be interesting to compare the cost of gas to run both cars for a year. To determine this, we will need to know the miles per gallon both cars get, as well as the number of miles we expect to drive in a year. From that information, we can find the number of gallons required from a year. Using the price of gas per gallon, we can find the running cost.  From Hyundai’s website, the 2013 Sonata will get 24 miles per gallon (mpg) in the city, and 35 mpg on the highway. The hybrid will get 35 mpg in the city, and 40 mpg on the highway.  An average driver drives about 12,000 miles a year. Suppose that you expect to drive about 75% of that in the city, so 9,000 city miles a year, and 3,000 highway miles a year.  We can then find the number of gallons each car would require for the year.  Sonata:  gallons.  Hybrid:  gallons.  If gas in your area averages about $3.50 per gallon, we can use that to find the running cost:  Sonata:  Hybrid:  The hybrid will save $450.10 a year. The gas costs for the hybrid are about lower than the costs for the standard Sonata.  While both the absolute and relative comparisons are useful here, they still make it hard to answer the original question, since is it worth it implies there is some tradeoff for the gas savings. Indeed, the hybrid Sonata costs about $25,850, compared to the base model for the regular Sonata, at $20,895.  To better answer the is it worth it question, we might explore how long it will take the gas savings to make up for the additional initial cost. The hybrid costs $4965 more. With gas savings of $451.10 a year, it will take about 11 years for the gas savings to make up for the higher initial costs.  We can conclude that if you expect to own the car 11 years, the hybrid is indeed worth it. If you plan to own the car for less than 11 years, it may still be worth it, since the resale value of the hybrid may be higher, or for other non-monetary reasons. This is a case where math can help guide your decision, but it can’t make it for you.

There is not enough information provided to answer the question, so we will have to make some assumptions, and look up some values.  Assumptions:    We own a car. Suppose it gets 24 miles to the gallon. We will only consider gas cost.  We will not need to rent a car in Spokane, but will need to get a taxi from the airport to the conference hotel downtown and back.  We can get someone to drop us off at the airport, so we don’t need to consider airport parking.  We will not consider whether we will lose money by having to take time off work to drive.    Values looked up (your values may be different)    Flight cost: $184  Taxi cost: $25 each way (estimate, according to hotel website)  Driving distance: 280 miles each way  Gas cost: $3.79 a gallon    Cost for flying: $184 flight cost + $50 in taxi fares = $234.  Cost for driving: 560 miles round trip will require 23.3 gallons of gas, costing $88.31.  Based on these assumptions, driving is cheaper. However, our assumption that we only include gas cost may not be a good one. Tax law allows you deduct $0.55 (in 2012) for each mile driven, a value that accounts for gas as well as a portion of the car cost, insurance, maintenance, etc. Based on this number, the cost of driving would be $319.

If you eat 4, how many calories will you consume?   There are several possible solution pathways to answer this question. We will explore one.  To answer the question of how many calories 4 mini-muffins will contain, we would want to know the number of calories in each mini-muffin. To find the calories in each mini-muffin, we could first find the total calories for the entire recipe, then divide it by the number of mini-muffins produced. To find the total calories for the recipe, we could multiply the calories per standard muffin by the number per muffin. Notice that this produces a multi-step solution pathway. It is often easier to solve a problem in small steps, rather than trying to find a way to jump directly from the given information to the solution.  We can now execute our plan:  calories for the whole recipe.  calories per mini-muffin.  calories consumed.   "

  "body": " You need to replace the boards on your deck. About how much will the materials cost?   There are two approaches we could take to this problem: 1) estimate the number of boards we will need and find the cost per board, or 2) estimate the area of the deck and find the approximate cost per square foot for deck boards. We will take the latter approach.  For this solution pathway, we will be able to answer the question if we know the cost per square foot for decking boards and the square footage of the deck. To find the cost per square foot for decking boards, we could compute the area of a single board, and divide it into the cost for that board. We can compute the square footage of the deck using geometric formulas. So first we need information: the dimensions of the deck, and the cost and dimensions of a single deck board.  Suppose that measuring the deck, it is rectangular, measuring 16 ft by 24 ft, for a total area of .  From a visit to the local home store, you find that an 8 foot by 4 inch cedar deck board costs about $7.50. The area of this board, doing the necessary conversion from inches to feet, is:   The cost per square foot is then per square foot.  This will allow us to estimate the material cost for the whole 384 square foot deck.   Of course, this cost estimate assumes that there is no waste, which is rarely the case. It is common to add at least 10% to the cost estimate to account for waste.   "

  "body": " Is it worth buying a Hyundai Sonata hybrid instead the regular Hyundai Sonata?   To make this decision, we must first decide what our basis for comparison will be. For the purposes of this example, we’ll focus on fuel and purchase costs, but environmental impacts and maintenance costs are other factors a buyer might consider.  It might be interesting to compare the cost of gas to run both cars for a year. To determine this, we will need to know the miles per gallon both cars get, as well as the number of miles we expect to drive in a year. From that information, we can find the number of gallons required from a year. Using the price of gas per gallon, we can find the running cost.  From Hyundai’s website, the 2013 Sonata will get 24 miles per gallon (mpg) in the city, and 35 mpg on the highway. The hybrid will get 35 mpg in the city, and 40 mpg on the highway.  An average driver drives about 12,000 miles a year. Suppose that you expect to drive about 75% of that in the city, so 9,000 city miles a year, and 3,000 highway miles a year.  We can then find the number of gallons each car would require for the year.  Sonata:  gallons.  Hybrid:  gallons.  If gas in your area averages about $3.50 per gallon, we can use that to find the running cost:  Sonata:  Hybrid:  The hybrid will save $450.10 a year. The gas costs for the hybrid are about lower than the costs for the standard Sonata.  While both the absolute and relative comparisons are useful here, they still make it hard to answer the original question, since is it worth it implies there is some tradeoff for the gas savings. Indeed, the hybrid Sonata costs about $25,850, compared to the base model for the regular Sonata, at $20,895.  To better answer the is it worth it question, we might explore how long it will take the gas savings to make up for the additional initial cost. The hybrid costs $4965 more. With gas savings of $451.10 a year, it will take about 11 years for the gas savings to make up for the higher initial costs.  We can conclude that if you expect to own the car 11 years, the hybrid is indeed worth it. If you plan to own the car for less than 11 years, it may still be worth it, since the resale value of the hybrid may be higher, or for other non-monetary reasons. This is a case where math can help guide your decision, but it can’t make it for you.   "

The sound of lightning (thunder) travels at the speed of sound, which is about 750 miles per hour.  If you see a flash of lightning, then hear the thunder 4 seconds later, how far away is the lightning?  Now let’s generalize that result. Suppose it takes n seconds to hear the thunder after a flash of lightning. How far away is the lightning, in terms of n?    The time it takes the light to reach you is so tiny for any reasonable distance that we can safely ignore it. 750 miles\/hr is about 0.21 miles\/sec. If the sound takes 4 seconds to reach you, the lightning is about 0.84 miles away. In general, the lightning will be miles away, which is often approximated by dividing the number of seconds by 5. "

It is natural for us to classify items into groups, or sets, and consider how those sets overlap with each other. We can use these sets understand relationships between groups, and to analyze survey data.  An art collector might own a collection of paintings, while a music lover might keep a collection of CDs. Any collection of items can form a set .   Set  A set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements of the set  A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elements of the set, enclosed in curly brackets.    Some examples of sets defined by describing the contents:  The set of all even numbers  The set of all books written about travel to Chile    Some examples of sets defined by listing the elements of the set:  {1, 3, 9, 12}  {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple}     A set simply specifies the contents; order is not important. The set represented by {1, 2, 3} is equivalent to the set {3, 1, 2}.  Notation  Commonly, we will use a variable to represent a set, to make it easier to refer to that set later.  The symbol means is an element of .  A set that contains no elements, { }, is called the empty set and is notated .    Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}  To notate that 2 is element of the set, we’d write .   Sometimes a collection might not contain all the elements of a set. For example, Chris owns three Madonna albums. While Chris’s collection is a set, we can also say it is a subset of the larger set of all Madonna albums.  Subset  A subset of a set A is another set that contains only elements from the set A, but may not contain all the elements of A.  If B is a subset of A, we write  A proper subset is a subset that is not identical to the original set - it contains fewer elements.  If B is a proper subset of A, we write    Consider these three sets  the set of all even numbers, ,  Here since every element of is also an even number, so is an element of  More formally, we could say since if , then .

What is a larger set this might be a subset of?  There are several answers: The set of all odd numbers less than 10. The set of all odd numbers. The set of all integers. The set of all real numbers.   Often times we are interested in the number of items in a set or subset. This is called the cardinality of the set.  Cardinality  The number of elements in a set is the cardinality of that set.  The cardinality, or cardinal number, of the set A is often notated as .

  "body": "Venn Diagrams    Illustrate set operations with Venn diagrams.    To visualize the interaction of sets, John Venn in 1880 thought to use overlapping circles, building on a similar idea used by Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. These illustrations now called Venn Diagrams.  Venn Diagrams  A Venn diagram represents each set by a circle, usually drawn inside of a containing box representing the universal set. Overlapping areas indicate elements common to both sets.   Basic Venn diagrams can illustrate the interaction of two or three sets.   Create Venn diagrams to illustrate             contains all elements in either set.   The union of two sets contains everything in either set.   contains only those elements in both sets - in the overlap of the circles.  The intersection of two sets contains the region in both sets--where they overlap.   will contain all elements not in the set A. will contain the elements in set B that are not in set A.

  "body": "Survey Problems    Solve survey problems with Venn diagrams.    Sometimes we may be interested in the cardinality of the union or intersection of sets, but not know the actual elements of each set. This is common in surveying.   A survey asks 200 people “What beverage do you drink in the morning”, and offers choices:    Tea only  Coffee only  Both coffee and tea    Suppose 20 report tea only, 80 report coffee only, 40 report both. How many people drink tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea or coffee?   This question can most easily be answered by creating a Venn diagram. We can see that we can find the people who drink tea by adding those who drink only tea to those who drink both: 60 people.  We can also see that those who drink neither are those not contained in the any of the three other groupings, so we can count those by subtracting from the cardinality of the universal set, 200.  people who drink neither.  Venn Diagram: 80 only coffee; 20 coffee and tea; 20 only tea     A survey asks: Which online services have you used in the last month:    Twitter  Facebook  Have used both    The results show 40% of those surveyed have used Twitter, 70% have used Facebook, and 20% have used both. How many people have used neither Twitter or Facebook?   Let T be the set of all people who have used Twitter, and F be the set of all people who have used Facebook. Notice that while the cardinality of F is 70% and the cardinality of T is 40%, the cardinality of is not simply 70% + 40%, since that would count those who use both services twice. To find the cardinality of , we can add the cardinality of F and the cardinality of T, then subtract those in intersection that we’ve counted twice. In symbols,    Now, to find how many people have not used either service, we’re looking for the cardinality of  Since the universal set contains 100% of people and the cardinality of , the cardinality of must be the other 10%.    The previous example illustrated two important properties   Cardinality Properties     Notice that the first property can also be written in an equivalent form by solving for the cardinality of the intersection:    Fifty students were surveyed, and asked if they were taking a social science (SS), humanities (HM) or a natural science (NS) course the next quarter.    21 were taking a SS course  26 were taking a HM course  19 were taking a NS course  9 were taking SS and HM  7 were taking SS and NS  10 were taking HM and NS  3 were taking all three  7 were taking none    How many students are only taking a SS course?   Venn Diagram with various regions labeled.  It might help to look at a Venn diagram. From the given data, we know that there are 3 students in region e and 7 students in region h.  Since 7 students were taking a SS and NS course, we know that n(d) + n(e) = 7. Since we know there are 3 students in region 3, there must be 7 - 3 = 4 students in region d.  Similarly, since there are 10 students taking HM and NS, which includes regions e and f, there must be 10 - 3 = 7 students in region f.  Since 9 students were taking SS and HM, there must be 9 - 3 = 6 students in region b.  Now, we know that 21 students were taking a SS course. This includes students from regions a, b, d, and e. Since we know the number of students in all but region a, we can determine that 21 - 6 - 4 - 3 = 8 students are in region a.  8 students are taking only a SS course.    Try It Now  One hundred fifty people were surveyed and asked if they believed in UFOs, ghosts, and Bigfoot.    43 believed in UFOs  44 believed in ghosts  25 believed in Bigfoot  10 believed in UFOs and ghosts  8 believed in ghosts and Bigfoot  5 believed in UFOs and Bigfoot  2 believed in all three    How many people surveyed believed in none of these things?   Starting with the intersection of all three circles, we work our way out. Since 10 people believe in UFOs and Ghosts, and 2 believe in all three, that leaves 8 that believe in only UFOs and Ghosts. We work our way out, filling in all the regions. Once we have, we can add up all those regions, getting 91 people in the union of all three sets. This leaves who believe in none.  Venn Diagram with labels from the problem.     A streaming service surveyed the viewing preferences of 50 users. The following information was obtained:    10 want to watch movies, TV shows, and documentaries  16 want to watch movies and documentaries  11 only want to see movies  16 want to see movies but not documentaries  14 want to see TV shows and documentaries  27 want to see TV shows  40 want to see movies or documentaries    Create a Venn diagram to descrive this data. Then determine the number of people who are only interested in watching documentaries.   Venn Diagram with labels from the problem.  We can start by putting 10 in region e, since 10 people are interested in all three.  Since 16 people want to see movies and documentaries, regions e and f must add up to 16. 16 - 10 = 6, so there are 6 people in region f.  11 people only want to see movies, so region c must be 11.  16 want to see movies, but not documentaries. This would include the part of circle M that is not overlapping with circle D. Regions b and c must add up to 16. There are 11 people in region c, so b = 16 - 11 = 5.  14 want to see TV shows and documentaries. Regions d and e add up to 14, so d = 14 - 10 = 4.  27 want to see TV shows. Everything in the TV circle must add up to 27--that includes regions a, b, d, and e. Region a = 27 - 5 - 10 - 4 = 8.  40 want to see either movies or documentaries. , so the regions in sets M or D must add up to 40. We already know regions b, c, d, e, and f. Those add up to , so there must be 4 people in region g.  Finally, the sum of all the people inside the sets is 48. Since 50 people were surveyed there are 2 people in region h.  Completed Venn Diagram  The number of people only interested in watch documentaries would be those in region g. There are 4 people only interested in documentaries.    "

  "title": "Introduction to Logic",
  "body": "Introduction to Logic    Introduce Boolean logic.  Define conditional statements.  Discuss quantified statements and how to negate them.  Write statements in symbolic form.    Logic is, basically, the study of valid reasoning. When searching the internet, we use Boolean logic - terms like “and” and “or” - to help us find specific web pages that fit in the sets we are interested in. After exploring this form of logic, we will look at logical arguments and how we can determine the validity of a claim.  Boolean Logic  We can often classify items as belonging to sets. If you went the library to search for a book and they asked you to express your search using unions, intersections, and complements of sets, that would feel a little strange. Instead, we typically using words like “and”, “or”, and “not” to connect our keywords together to form a search. These words, which form the basis of Boolean logic, are directly related to our set operations. (Boolean logic was developed by the 19th-century English mathematician George Boole.)  Boolean Logic  Boolean logic combines multiple statements that are either true or false into an expression that is either true or false.  In connection to sets, a search is true if the element is part of the set.   Suppose M is the set of all mystery books, and C is the set of all comedy books. If we search for “mystery”, we are looking for all the books that are an element of the set M; the search is true for books that are in the set.  When we search for “mystery and comedy”, we are looking for a book that is an element of both sets, in the intersection. If we were to search for “mystery or comedy”, we are looking for a book that is a mystery, a comedy, or both, which is the union of the sets. If we searched for “not comedy”, we are looking for any book in the library that is not a comedy, the complement of the set C.   Connection to Set Operations  A and B: elements in the intersection  A or B: elements in the union  not A: elements in the complement   Notice here that or is not exclusive. This is a difference between the Boolean logic use of the word and common everyday use. When your significant other asks “do you want to go to the park or the movies?” they usually are proposing an exclusive choice - one option or the other, but not both. In Boolean logic, the or is not exclusive - more like being asked at a restaurant “would you like fries or a drink with that?” Answering “both, please” is an acceptable answer.   Suppose we are searching a library database for Mexican universities. Express a reasonable search using Boolean logic.  We could start with the search “Mexico and university”, but would be likely to find results for the U.S. state New Mexico. To account for this, we could revise our search to read: Mexico and university not “New Mexico”.   In most internet search engines, it is not necessary to include the word and; the search engine assumes that if you provide two keywords you are looking for both. In Google’s search, the keyword or has be capitalized as OR, and a negative sign in front of a word is used to indicate not. Quotes around a phrase indicate that the entire phrase should be looked for. The search from the previous example on Google could be written: Mexico university -“New Mexico”.   Describe the numbers that meet the condition:  even and less than 10 and greater than 0  The numbers that satisfy all three requirements are {2, 4, 6, 8}   Sometimes statements made in English can be ambiguous. For this reason, Boolean logic uses parentheses to show precedent, just like in algebraic order of operations.   Describe the numbers that meet the condition:  odd number and less than 20 and greater than 0 and (multiple of 3 or multiple of 5)  The first three conditions limit us to the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19}  The last grouped conditions tell us to find elements of this set that are also either a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 5. This leaves us with the set {3, 5, 9, 15}  Notice that we would have gotten a very different result if we had written  (odd number and less than 20 and greater than 0 and multiple of 3) or multiple of 5  The first grouped set of conditions would give {3, 9, 15}. When combined with the last condition, though, this set expands without limits:  {3, 5, 9, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, …}    The English phrase “Go to the store and buy me eggs and bagels or cereal” is ambiguous; it is not clear whether the requestors is asking for eggs always along with either bagels or cereal, or whether they’re asking for either the combination of eggs and bagels, or just cereal.  For this reason, using parentheses clarifies the intent:  Eggs and (bagels or cereal) means Option 1: Eggs and bagels, Option 2: Eggs and cereal  (Eggs and bagels) or cereal means Option 1: Eggs and bagels, Option 2: Cereal   Be aware that when a string of conditions is written without grouping symbols, it is often interpreted from the left to right, resulting in the latter interpretation.   Conditional Statements  Beyond searching, Boolean logic is commonly used in spreadsheet applications like Excel to do conditional calculations. A statement is something that is either true or false. A statement like is true; a statement like “a rat is a fish” is false. A statement like ” is true for some values of x and false for others. When an action is taken or not depending on the value of a statement, it forms a conditional.  Statements and Conditionals  A statement is either true or false.  A conditional is a compound statement of the form “if p then q” or “if p then q, else s”.    In common language, an example of a conditional statement would be “If it is raining, then we’ll go to the mall. Otherwise we’ll go for a hike.”  The statement “If it is raining” is the condition - this may be true or false for any given day. If the condition is true, then we will follow the first course of action, and go to the mall. If the condition is false, then we will use the alternative, and go for a hike.     A parent might say to their child “if you clean your room and take out the garbage, then you can have ice cream.”  Here, there are two simpler conditions:  The child cleaning her room.  The child taking out the garbage   Since these conditions were joined with and, the combined conditional will be true only if both simpler conditions are true; if either chore is not completed, then the parent’s condition is not met.  Notice that if the parent had said “if you clean your room or take out the garbage, then you can have ice cream”, then the child would need to complete only one chore to meet the condition.    Quantified Statements  Words that describe an entire set, such as “all”, “every”, or “none”, are called universal quantifiers because that set could be considered a universal set. In contrast, words or phrases such as “some”, “one”, or “at least one” are called existential quantifiers because they describe the existence of at least one element in a set.  Quantifiers  A universal quantifier states that an entire set of things share a characteristic.  An existential quantifier states that a set contains at least one element.   Something interesting happens when we negate - or state the opposite of - a quantified statement.   Suppose your friend says “Everybody cheats on their taxes.” What is the minimum amount of evidence you would need to prove your friend wrong?  To show that it is not true that everybody cheats on their taxes, all you need is one person who does not cheat on their taxes. It would be perfectly fine to produce more people who do not cheat, but one counterexample is all you need.  It is important to note that you do not need to show that absolutely nobody cheats on their taxes.    Suppose your friend says “One of these six cartons of milk is leaking.” What is the minimum amount of evidence you would need to prove your friend wrong?  In this case, you would need to check all six cartons and show that none of them is leaking. You cannot disprove your friend’s statement by checking only one of the cartons.   When we negate a statement with a universal quantifier, we get a statement with an existential quantifier, and vice-versa.  Negating a quantified statement  The negation of “all A are B” is “at least one A is not B”.  The negation of “no A are B” is “at least one A is B”.  The negation of “at least one A is B” is “no A are B”.  The negation of “at least one A is not B” is “all A are B”    “Somebody brought a flashlight.” Write the negation of this statement.  The negation is “Nobody brought a flashlight.”    “There are no prime numbers that are even.” Write the negation of this statement.  The negation is “At least one prime number is even.   Try It Now  Write the negation of “All Icelandic children learn English in school.”  At least one Icelandic child did not learn English in school.    Statements in Symbolic Form.  Before we focus on truth tables, we’re going to introduce some symbols that are commonly used for and, or, and not.  Symbols  Some of the symbols that are used for and, or, and not are:  The symbol is used for and : A and B is notated  The symbol is used for or : A or B is notated  The symbol is used for not : not A is notated   You can remember the first two symbols by relating them to the shapes for the union and intersection. would be the elements that exist in both sets, in . Likewise, would be the elements that exist in either set, in . When we are working with sets, we use the rounded version of the symbols; when we are working with statements, we use the pointy version.   Translate each statement into symbolic notation. Let P represent “I like Pepsi” and let C represent “I like Coke”.    I like Pepsi or I like Coke.  I like Pepsi and I like Coke.  I do not like Pepsi.  It is not the case that I like Pepsi or Coke.  I like Pepsi and I do not like Coke.             As you can see, we can use parentheses to organize more complicated statements.    Try It Now  Translate “We have carrots or we will not make soup” into symbols. Let C represent “we have carrots” and let S represent “we will make soup”.     "

  "body": "Truth Tables    Create truth tables for conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations.  Determine if statements are logically equivalent.  Understand and apply DeMorgan’s Laws.    This section describes how to create truth tables and discusses alternate forms of conditional statements.  Truth Tables: Conjuction (and), Disjunction (or), Negation (not)  Because complex Boolean statements can get tricky to think about, we can create a truth table to keep track of what truth values for the simple statements make the complex statement true and false.  Truth Tables  A table showing what the resulting truth value of a complex statement is for all the possible truth values for the simple statements.    Suppose you’re picking out a new couch, and your significant other says “get a sectional or something with a chaise”.  This is a complex statement made of two simpler conditions: “is a sectional”, and “has a chaise”. For simplicity, let’s use S to designate “is a sectional”, and C to designate “has a chaise”.  A truth table for this situation would look like this:   Truth Table            T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F     In the table, T is used for true, and F for false. In the first row, if S is true and C is also true, then the complex statement “S or C” is true. This would be a sectional that also has a chaise, which meets our desire. (Remember that or in logic is not exclusive; if the couch has both features, it meets the condition.)   In the previous example about the couch, the truth table was really just summarizing what we already know about how the or statement work. The truth tables for the basic and, or, and not statements are shown below.   Conjuction            T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F      Disjuction            T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F      Negation          T  F    F  T     Truth tables really become useful when we analyze more complex Boolean statements   Create a truth table for the statement   When we create the truth table, first list the variables involved. Then rewrite the statement leaving a column for each part of the statement.   Creating a Truth Table: Step 1               Then we need to list all the possible truth value combinations for A and B. Notice how the first column contains 2 Ts followed by 2 Fs, and the second column alternates T, F, T, F. This pattern ensures that all 4 combinations are considered.   Creating a Truth Table: Step 2              T  T  T   F    T  F  T   T    F  T  F   F    F  F  F   T     Notice that we had change the T's to F's and F's to T's when filling out the column for  Finally we can fill out the column with the . The disjunction is true when at least one of the values in or is true.   Creating a Truth Table: Step 3              T  T  T  T  F    T  F  T  T  T    F  T  F  F  F    F  F  F  T  T     The last column we completed is our final answer: TTFT  The truth table shows that is true in three cases and false in one case. If you’re wondering what the point of this is, suppose it is the last day of the baseball season and two teams, who are not playing each other, are competing for the final playoff spot. Anaheim will make the playoffs if it wins its game or if Boston does not win its game. (Anaheim owns the tie-breaker; if both teams win, or if both teams lose, then Anaheim gets the playoff spot.) If A = Anaheim wins its game and B = Boston wins its game, then represents the situation “Anaheim wins its game or Boston does not win its game”. The truth table shows us the different scenarios related to Anaheim making the playoffs. In the first row, Anaheim wins its game and Boston wins its game, so it is true that Anaheim makes the playoffs.

They allow us to rewrite the negation of a conjunction as a disjunction, and vice-versa.  For example, suppose you want to schedule a meeting with two colleagues at 4:30PM on Friday, and you need both of them to be available at that time. What situation would make it impossible to have the meeting? It is NOT the case that colleague a is available AND colleague b is available: . This situation is equivalent to either colleague a NOT being available OR colleague b NOT being available: .  De Morgan's Laws  The negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of the statements making up the conjunction. To negate an \"and\" statement, negate each part and change the \"and\" to \"or\".  is equivalent to  The negation of a disjunction is equivalent to the conjunction of the negation of the statements making up the disjunction. To negate an \"or\" statement, negate each part and change the \"or\" to \"and\".  is equivalent to    For Valentine’s Day, you did not get your sweetie flowers or candy: Which of the following statements is logically equivalent?  You did not get them flowers or did not get them candy.  You did not get them flowers and did not get them candy.  You got them flowers or got them candy.      This statement does not go far enough; it leaves open the possibility that you got them one of the two things.  This statement is equivalent to the original; is equivalent to .  This statement says that you got them something, but we know that you did not.     Statements are logically equivalent if they have the same values in a truth table. We can use truth tables to verify DeMorgan's laws.   Compare truth tables for and . Are the statements logically equivalent?   The truth table for is:     p  q       T  T  F  F  F    T  F  F  T  T    F  T  T  T  F    F  F  T  T  T    Step 1  Step 1  Step 2  Step 3  Step 2     Notice the values in the column labled \"Step 3\" are FTTT.

Both of these statements have truth tables that result in FTTT, so they are logically equivalent.    Try It Now  To serve as the President of the US, a person must have been born in the US, must be at least 35 years old, and must have lived in the US for at least 14 years. What minimum set of conditions would disqualify someone from serving as President?  Failing to meet just one of the three conditions is all it takes to be disqualified. A person is disqualified if they were not born in the US, or are not at least 35 years old, or have not lived in the US for at least 14 years. The key word here is “or” instead of “and”.     "

  "body": "Conditional Statements    Create truth tables for conditional statements.  Identify alternate forms of conditional statements, including the inverse, converse, and contrapositive.  Negate conditional statements.  Create truth tables for biconditional statements.     We discussed conditional statements earlier, in which we take an action based on the value of the condition. We are now going to look at another version of a conditional, sometimes called an implication, which states that the second part must logically follow from the first.   Truth Tables: Conditional Statements  Conditional  A conditional is a logical compound statement in which a statement p, called the antecedent, implies a statement q, called the consequent.  A conditional is written as and is translated as “if p, then q”.    The English statement “If it is raining, then there are clouds is the sky” is a conditional statement. It makes sense because if the antecedent “it is raining” is true, then the consequent “there are clouds in the sky” must also be true.   Notice that the statement tells us nothing of what to expect if it is not raining; there might be clouds in the sky, or there might not. If the antecedent is false, then the consquent becomes irrelevant.   Suppose you order a team jersey online on Tuesday and want to receive it by Friday so you can wear it to Saturday’s game. The website says that if you pay for expedited shipping, you will receive the jersey by Friday. In what situation is the website telling a lie?  There are four possible outcomes:  You pay for expedited shipping and receive the jersey by Friday  You pay for expedited shipping and don’t receive the jersey by Friday  You don’t pay for expedited shipping and receive the jersey by Friday  You don’t pay for expedited shipping and don’t receive the jersey by Friday   Only one of these outcomes proves that the website was lying: the second outcome in which you pay for expedited shipping but don’t receive the jersey by Friday. The first outcome is exactly what was promised, so there’s no problem with that. The third outcome is not a lie because the website never said what would happen if you didn’t pay for expedited shipping; maybe the jersey would arrive by Friday whether you paid for expedited shipping or not. The fourth outcome is not a lie because, again, the website didn’t make any promises about when the jersey would arrive if you didn’t pay for expedited shipping.    A friend tells you “If you upload that picture to Facebook, you’ll lose your job.” Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?  There are four possible outcomes:  You upload the picture and lose your job  You upload the picture and don’t lose your job  You don’t upload the picture and lose your job  You don’t upload the picture and don’t lose your job   There is only one possible case in which you can say your friend was wrong: the second outcome in which you upload the picture but still keep your job. In the last two cases, your friend didn’t say anything about what would happen if you didn’t upload the picture, so you can’t say that their statement was wrong. Even if you didn’t upload the picture and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn’t upload the picture; you might lose your job for missing a shift or punching your boss instead.   In traditional logic, a conditional is considered true as long as there are no cases in which the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.   Truth Table for the Conditional            T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T      Alternate Forms of Conditional Statements  For any conditional, there are three related statements, the converse, the inverse, and the contrapositive.  Statements Related to the Conditional  The original conditional is “if p, then q”  The converse is “if q, then p”  The inverse is “if not p, then not q”  The contrapositive is “if not q, then not p”    Consider again the conditional “If it is raining, then there are clouds in the sky.” It seems reasonable to assume that this is true.  The converse would be “If there are clouds in the sky, then it is raining.” This is not always true.  The inverse would be “If it is not raining, then there are not clouds in the sky.” Likewise, this is not always true.  The contrapositive would be “If there are not clouds in the sky, then it is not raining.” This statement is true, and is equivalent to the original conditional.   Looking at truth tables, we can see that the original conditional and the contrapositive are logically equivalent, and that the converse and inverse are logically equivalent.   Conditional and Related Statements      Conditional  Converse  Inverse  Contrapositive            T  T  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  T  T  F    F  T  T  F  F  T    T  T  T  T  T  T     Equivalence  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The converse and inverse of a conditional statement are logically equivalent.   In other words, the original statement and the contrapositive must agree with each other; they must both be true, or they must both be false. Similarly, the converse and the inverse must agree with each other; they must both be true, or they must both be false.  Be aware that symbolic logic cannot represent the English language perfectly. For example, we may need to change the verb tense to show that one thing occurred before another.   Suppose this statement is true: “If I eat this giant cookie, then I will feel sick.” Which of the following statements must also be true?    If I feel sick, then I ate that giant cookie.  If I don’t eat this giant cookie, then I won’t feel sick.  If I don’t feel sick, then I didn’t eat that giant cookie.      This is the converse, which is not necessarily true. I could feel sick for some other reason, such as drinking sour milk.  This is the inverse, which is not necessarily true. Again, I could feel sick for some other reason; avoiding the cookie doesn’t guarantee that I won’t feel sick.  This is the contrapositive, which is true, but we have to think somewhat backwards to explain it. If I ate the cookie, I would feel sick, but since I don’t feel sick, I must not have eaten the cookie.   Notice again that the original statement and the contrapositive have the same truth value (both are true), and the converse and the inverse have the same truth value (both are false).    Try It Now  “If you microwave salmon in the staff kitchen, then I will be mad at you.” If this statement is true, which of the following statements must also be true?  If you don’t microwave salmon in the staff kitchen, then I won’t be mad at you.  If I am not mad at you, then you didn’t microwave salmon in the staff kitchen.  If I am mad at you, then you microwaved salmon in the staff kitchen.   Choice b is correct because it is the contrapositive of the original statement.   Consider the statement “If you park here, then you will get a ticket.” What set of conditions would prove this statement false?  You don’t park here and you get a ticket.  You don’t park here and you don’t get a ticket.  You park here and you don’t get a ticket.   The first two statements are irrelevant because we don’t know what will happen if you park somewhere else. The third statement, however contradicts the conditional statement “If you park here, then you will get a ticket” because you parked here but didn’t get a ticket. This example demonstrates a general rule; the negation of a conditional can be written as a conjunction: “It is not the case that if you park here, then you will get a ticket” is equivalent to “You park here and you do not get a ticket.”  The Negation of a Conditional  The negation of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to a conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent.  is equivalent to    Which of the following statements is equivalent to the negation of “If you don’t grease the pan, then the food will stick to it” ?  I didn’t grease the pan and the food didn’t stick to it.  I didn’t grease the pan and the food stuck to it.  I greased the pan and the food didn’t stick to it.      This is correct; it is the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent. To disprove that not greasing the pan will cause the food to stick, I have to not grease the pan and have the food not stick.  This is essentially the original statement with no negation; the “if…then” has been replaced by “and”.  This essentially agrees with the original statement and cannot disprove it.     Try It Now  “If you go swimming less than an hour after eating lunch, then you will get cramps.” Which of the following statements is equivalent to the negation of this statement?  I went swimming more than an hour after eating lunch and I got cramps.  I went swimming less than an hour after eating lunch and I didn’t get cramps.  I went swimming more than an hour after eating lunch and I didn’t get cramps.   Choice b is equivalent to the negation; it keeps the first part the same and negates the second part.    Biconditional Statements  In everyday life, we often have a stronger meaning in mind when we use a conditional statement. Consider “If you submit your hours today, then you will be paid next Friday.” What the payroll rep really means is “If you submit your hours today, then you will be paid next Friday, and if you don’t submit your hours today, then you won’t be paid next Friday.” The conditional statement if t, then p also includes the inverse of the statement: if not t, then not p. A more compact way to express this statement is “You will be paid next Friday if and only if you submit your timesheet today.” A statement of this form is called a biconditional .  Biconditional  A biconditional is a logical conditional statement in which the antecedent and consequent are interchangeable.  A biconditional is written as and is translated as “p if and only if q”.   Because a biconditional statement is equivalent to , we may think of it as a conditional statement combined with its converse: if p, then q and if q, then p. The double-headed arrow shows that the conditional statement goes from left to right and from right to left. A biconditional is considered true as long as the antecedent and the consequent have the same truth value; that is, they are either both true or both false.   Truth Table for the Biconditional            T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  T     Notice that the fourth row, where both components are false, is true; if you don’t submit your timesheet and you don’t get paid, the person from payroll told you the truth.   Suppose this statement is true: “The garbage truck comes down my street if and only if it is Thursday morning.” Which of the following statements could be true?  It is noon on Thursday and the garbage truck did not come down my street this morning.  It is Monday and the garbage truck is coming down my street.  It is Wednesday at 11:59PM and the garbage truck did not come down my street today.      This cannot be true. This is like the second row of the truth table; it is true that I just experienced Thursday morning, but it is false that the garbage truck came.  This cannot be true. This is like the third row of the truth table; it is false that it is Thursday, but it is true that the garbage truck came.  This could be true. This is like the fourth row of the truth table; it is false that it is Thursday, but it is also false that the garbage truck came, so everything worked out like it should.     Try It Now  Suppose this statement is true: “I wear my running shoes if and only if I am exercising.” Determine whether each of the following statements must be true or false.  I am exercising and I am not wearing my running shoes.  I am wearing my running shoes and I am not exercising.  I am not exercising and I am not wearing my running shoes.   Choices a and b are false; c is true.    "

  "title": "Arguments",
  "body": "Arguments    Identify inductive and deductive reasoning.  Evaluate arguments with truth tables.  Discover forms of valid and invalid arguments.  Discuss logical fallacies.    A logical argument is a claim that a set of premises support a conclusion. This section will define the different arguments types and discuss how truth tables can be used to determine whether an arugment is valid or invalid.  Argument Types  There are two general types of arguments:  An inductive argument uses a collection of specific examples as its premises and uses them to propose a general conclusion.  A deductive argument uses a collection of general statements as its premises and uses them to propose a specific situation as the conclusion.   The argument “when I went to the store last week I forgot my purse, and when I went today I forgot my purse. I always forget my purse when I go the store” is an inductive argument.  The premises are:  I forgot my purse last week  I forgot my purse today   The conclusion is:  I always forget my purse   Notice that the premises are specific situations, while the conclusion is a general statement. In this case, this is a fairly weak argument, since it is based on only two instances.    The argument “every day for the past year, a plane flies over my house at 2:00 P.M. A plane will fly over my house every day at 2:00 P.M.” is a stronger inductive argument, since it is based on a larger set of evidence. While it is not necessarily true—the airline may have cancelled its afternoon flight—it is probably a safe bet.    Evaluating inductive arguments  An inductive argument is never able to prove the conclusion true, but it can provide either weak or strong evidence to suggest that it may be true.   Many scientific theories, such as the big bang theory, can never be proven. Instead, they are inductive arguments supported by a wide variety of evidence. Usually in science, an idea is considered a hypothesis until it has been well tested, at which point it graduates to being considered a theory. Common scientific theories, like Newton’s theory of gravity, have all stood up to years of testing and evidence, though sometimes they need to be adjusted based on new evidence, such as when Einstein proposed the theory of general relativity  A deductive argument is more clearly valid or not, which makes it easier to evaluate.  Evaluating deductive arguments  A deductive argument is considered valid if, assuming that all the premises are true, the conclusion follows logically from those premises. In other words, when the premises are all true, the conclusion must be true.     Evaluating Dedutive Arguments with Truth Tables  Arguments can also be analyzed using truth tables, although this can be a lot of work.  To analyze an argument with a truth table:    Represent each of the premises and the conclusion symbolically  Create truth tables for each premise and for the conclusion.  The argument is valid if and only if the conclusion is true when all premises are true.    Consider the argument  Premise: If you bought bread, then you went to the store.  Premise: You bought bread.  Conclusion: You went to the store.  While this example is fairly obviously a valid argument, we can analyze it by representing the argument symbolically and then creating truth tables for the premises and conclusion.  We’ll let b represent “you bought bread” and s represent “you went to the store”. Then the argument becomes:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:   Verifying an Argument    Variable 1:  Variable 2:  Premise 1:  Premise 2:  Conclusion:    T  T  T  T  T    T  F  T  F  F    F  T  F  T  T    F  F  F  T  F     The only row where both premises are true is the first one. The conclusion is also true in the first row. Since the conclusion is true when both premises are true, this is a valid argument.   Try It Now  Use truth tables to determine whether the argument is valid:  If I have a shovel, I can dig a hole.  I dug a hole.  Therefore, I had a shovel.   Let s represent \"I have shovel\" and d represent \"I dug a hole.\"  In symbolic form, the argument is:     The truth tables for this argument are:   Verifying an Argument    Variable 1:  Variable 2:  Premise 1:  Premise 2:  Conclusion:    T  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  F  T    F  T  T  T  F    F  F  T  F  F     Both premises are true in both the first and third rows of the table. However, the conclusion is false in the third row. Since there is a situation where both premises are true and the conclusion is false (the third row of the table), this is an invalid argument.     Forms of Arguments  Rather than making a truth table for every argument, we may be able to recognize certain common forms of arguments that are valid (or invalid). If we can determine that an argument fits one of the common forms, we can immediately state whether it is valid or invalid.  Law of Detachment  The law of detachment applies when a conditional and its antecedent are given as premises, and the consequent is the conclusion.  The general form is:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:    Recall this argument from an earlier example:  Premise: If you bought bread, then you went to the store.  Premise: You bought bread.  Conclusion: You went to the store.  In symbolic form:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:  This argument has the structure described by the law of detachment. (The second premise and the conclusion are simply the two parts of the first premise detached from each other.) Instead of making a truth table, we can say that this argument is valid by stating that it satisfies the law of detachment.   Law of Contraposition  The law of contraposition applies when a conditional and the negation of its consequent are given as premises, and the negation of its antecedent is the conclusion.  The general form is:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:   Notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the contrapositive of the first premise, , but they have been detached. You can think of the law of contraposition as a combination of the law of detachment and the fact that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.   Premise: If I drop my phone into the swimming pool, my phone will be ruined.  Premise: My phone isn’t ruined.  Conclusion: I didn’t drop my phone into the swimming pool.  If we let d = I drop the phone in the pool and r = the phone is ruined, then we can represent the argument this way:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:  The form of this argument matches what we need to invoke the law of contraposition, so it is a valid argument.   Try It Now  Is this argument valid?  Premise: If you brushed your teeth before bed, then your toothbrush will be wet.  Premise: Your toothbrush is dry.  Conclusion: You didn’t brush your teeth before bed.  Yes, by the Law of Contraposition   The Transitive Property  The transitive property has as its premises a series of conditionals, where the consequent of one is the antecedent of the next. The conclusion is a conditional with the same antecedent as the first premise and the same consequent as the final premise.  The general form is:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:    Premise: If a soccer player commits a reckless foul, she will receive a yellow card.  Premise: If Hayley receives a yellow card, she will be suspended for the next match.  Conclusion: If Hayley commits a reckless foul, she will be suspended for the next match.  If we let r = committing a reckless foul, y = receiving a yellow card, and s = being suspended, then our argument looks like this:  Premise  Premise  Conclusion:  This argument has the exact structure required to use the transitive property, so it is a valid argument.   Dijunctive Syllogism  In a disjunctive syllogism, the premises consist of an or statement and the negation of one of the options. The conclusion is the other option.  The general form is:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:    The order of the two parts of the disjunction isn’t important. In other words, we could have the premises and , and the conclusion .   Premise: I can either drive or take the train.  Premise: I refuse to drive.  Conclusion: I will take the train.  If we let d = I drive and t = I take the train, then the symbolic representation of the argument is:  Premise  Premise  Conclusion:  This argument is valid because it has the form of a disjunctive syllogism. I have two choices, and one of them is not going to happen, so the other one must happen.   Keep in mind that, when you are determining the validity of an argument, you must assume that the premises are true. If you don’t agree with one of the premises, you need to keep your personal opinion out of it. Your job is to pretend that the premises are true and then determine whether they force you to accept the conclusion. You may attack the premises in a court of law or a political discussion, of course, but here we are focusing on the structure of the arguments, not the truth of what they actually say.  We have just looked at four forms of valid arguments; there are two common forms that represent invalid arguments, which are also called fallacies .  Fallacy of the Converse  The fallacy of the converse arises when a conditional and its consequent are given as premises, and the antecedent is the conclusion.  The general form is:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:   Notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the converse of the first premise, , but they have been detached. The fallacy of the converse incorrectly tries to assert that the converse of a statement is equivalent to that statement.   Premise: If I drink coffee after noon, then I have a hard time falling asleep that night.  Premise: I had a hard time falling asleep last night.  Conclusion: I drank coffee after noon yesterday.  If we let c = I drink coffee after noon and h = I have a hard time falling asleep, then our argument looks like this:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:  This argument uses converse reasoning, so it is an invalid argument. There could be plenty of other reasons why I couldn’t fall asleep: I could be worried about money, my neighbors might have been setting off fireworks, etc.   Fallacy of the Converse  The fallacy of the inverse occurs when a conditional and the negation of its antecedent are given as premises, and the negation of the consequent is the conclusion.  The general form is:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:   Again, notice that the second premise and the conclusion look like the inverse of the first premise, , but they have been detached. The fallacy of the inverse incorrectly tries to assert that the inverse of a statement is equivalent to that statement.   Premise: If you listen to the Grateful Dead, then you are a hippie.  Premise: Sky doesn’t listen to the Grateful Dead.  Conclusion: Sky is not a hippie.  If we let g = listen to the Grateful Dead and h = is a hippie, then this is the argument:  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:  This argument is invalid because it uses inverse reasoning. The first premise does not imply that all hippies listen to the Grateful Dead; there could be some hippies who listen to Phish instead.   Of course, arguments are not limited to these six basic forms; some arguments have more premises, or premises that need to be rearranged before you can see what is really happening. There are plenty of other forms of arguments that are invalid. If an argument doesn’t seem to fit the pattern of any of these common forms, though, you may want to use a Venn diagram or a truth table instead.  Lewis Carroll, author of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, was a math and logic teacher, and wrote two books on logic. In them, he would propose premises as a puzzle, to be connected using syllogisms. The following example is one such puzzle.   Solve the puzzle. In other words, find a logical conclusion from these premises.  All babies are illogical.  Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.  Illogical persons are despised.  Let b = is a baby, d = is despised, i = is illogical, and m = can manage a crocodile. Then we can write the premises as:     Writing the second premise correctly can be a challenge; it can be rephrased as “If you can manage a crocodile, then you are not despised.”  Using the transitive property with the first and third premises, we can conclude that ; that all babies are despised. Using the contrapositive of the second premise, , we can then use the transitive property with to conclude that ; that babies cannot manage crocodiles. While it is silly, this is a logical conclusion from the given premises.   Try It Now  Is this argument valid?  Premise: If I go to the party, I’ll be really tired tomorrow.  Premise: If I go to the party, I’ll get to see friends.  Conclusion: If I don’t see friends, I won’t be tired tomorrow   Let p = go to party, t = be tired, and f = see friends.  Premise:  Premise:  Conclusion:  We could try to rewrite the second premise using the contrapositive to state , but that does not allow us to form a syllogism. If I don’t see friends, then I didn’t go the party, but that is not sufficient to claim I won’t be tired tomorrow. Maybe I stayed up all night watching movies.     Logical Fallacies in Common Language  In the previous discussion, we saw that logical arguments can be invalid when the premises are not true, when the premises are not sufficient to guarantee the conclusion, or when there are invalid chains in logic. There are a number of other ways in which arguments can be invalid, a sampling of which are given here.  Ad hominem  An ad hominem argument attacks the person making the argument, ignoring the argument itself.    “Jane says that whales aren’t fish, but she’s only in the second grade, so she can’t be right.”  Here the argument is attacking Jane, not the validity of her claim, so this is an ad hominem argument.    “Jane says that whales aren’t fish, but everyone knows that they’re really mammals. She’s so stupid.”  This certainly isn’t very nice, but it is not ad hominem since a valid counterargument is made along with the personal insult.   Appeal to ignorance  This type of argument assumes something it true because it hasn’t been proven false    “Nobody has proven that photo isn’t of Bigfoot, so it must be Bigfoot.”   Appeal to authority  These arguments attempt to use the authority of a person to prove a claim. While often authority can provide strength to an argument, problems can occur when the person’s opinion is not shared by other experts, or when the authority is irrelevant to the claim.    “A diet high in bacon can be healthy; Doctor Atkins said so.”  Here, an appeal to the authority of a doctor is used for the argument. This generally would provide strength to the argument, except that the opinion that eating a diet high in saturated fat runs counter to general medical opinion. More supporting evidence would be needed to justify this claim.    “Jennifer Hudson lost weight with Weight Watchers, so their program must work.”  Here, there is an appeal to the authority of a celebrity. While her experience does provide evidence, it provides no more than any other person’s experience would.   Appeal to consequence  An appeal to consequence concludes that a premise is true or false based on whether the consequences are desirable or not.    “Humans will travel faster than light: faster-than-light travel would be beneficial for space travel.”   False dilemma  A false dilemma argument falsely frames an argument as an “either or” choice, without allowing for additional options.    “Either those lights in the sky were an airplane or aliens. There are no airplanes scheduled for tonight, so it must be aliens.”  This argument ignores the possibility that the lights could be something other than an airplane or aliens.   Circular reasoning  Circular reasoning is an argument that relies on the conclusion being true for the premise to be true.    “I shouldn’t have gotten a C in that class; I’m an A student!”  In this argument, the student is claiming that because they’re an A student, though shouldn’t have gotten a C. But because they got a C, they’re not an A student.   Post hoc (post hoc ergo propter hoc)  A post hoc argument claims that because two things happened sequentially, then the first must have caused the second.    “Today I wore a red shirt, and my football team won! I need to wear a red shirt every time they play to make sure they keep winning.”  Straw man A straw man argument involves misrepresenting the argument in a less favorable way to make it easier to attack.   “Senator Jones has proposed reducing military funding by 10%. Apparently he wants to leave us defenseless against attacks by terrorists”  Here the arguer has represented a 10% funding cut as equivalent to leaving us defenseless, making it easier to attack Senator Jones’ position.   Correlation implies causation  Similar to post hoc, but without the requirement of sequence, this fallacy assumes that just because two things are related one must have caused the other. Often there is a third variable not considered.   “Months with high ice cream sales also have a high rate of deaths by drowning. Therefore, ice cream must be causing people to drown.”  This argument is implying a causal relation, when really both are more likely dependent on the weather; that ice cream and drowning are both more likely during warm summer months.   Try It Now  Identify the logical fallacy in each of the arguments    Only an untrustworthy person would run for office. The fact that politicians are untrustworthy is proof of this.

The senator wants to increase support for food stamps. He wants to take the taxpayers’ hard-earned money and give it away to lazy people. This isn’t fair, so we shouldn’t do it.      Circular  Correlation does not imply causation  Post hoc  Appeal to consequence  Staw man      It may be difficult to identify one particular fallacy for an argument. Consider this argument: “Emma Watson says she’s a feminist, but she posed for these racy pictures. I’m a feminist, and no self-respecting feminist would do that.” Could this be ad hominem, saying that Emma Watson has no self-respect? Could it be appealing to authority because the person making the argument claims to be a feminist? Could it be a false dilemma because the argument assumes that a woman is either a feminist or not, with no gray area in between?   "

  "body": "Linear Growth    Create recursive and explicit linear models  Graph linear models  Apply linear models to real world applications    Marco is a collector of antique soda bottles. His collection currently contains 437 bottles. Every year, he budgets enough money to buy 32 new bottles. Can we determine how many bottles he will have in 5 years, and how long it will take for his collection to reach 1000 bottles?  While both of these questions you could probably solve without an equation or formal mathematics, we are going to formalize our approach to this problem to provide a means to answer more complicated questions.  Suppose that represents the number, or population, of bottles Marco has after n years. So would represent the number of bottles now, would represent the number of bottles after 1 year, would represent the number of bottles after 2 years, and so on. We could describe how Marco’s bottle collection is changing using:    This is called a recursive relationship. A recursive relationship is a formula which relates the next value in a sequence to the previous values. Here, the number of bottles in year n can be found by adding 32 to the number of bottles in the previous year, . Using this relationship, we could calculate:       We have answered the question of how many bottles Marco will have in 5 years. However, solving how long it will take for his collection to reach 1000 bottles would require a lot more calculations.  While recursive relationships are excellent for describing simply and cleanly how a quantity is changing, they are not convenient for making predictions or solving problems that stretch far into the future. For that, a closed or explicit form for the relationship is preferred. An explicit equation allows us to calculate directly, without needing to know . While you may already be able to guess the explicit equation, let us derive it from the recursive formula. We can do so by selectively not simplifying as we go:      You can probably see the pattern now, and generalize that   Using this equation, we can calculate how many bottles he’ll have after 5 years:   We can now also solve for when the collection will reach 1000 bottles by substituting in 1000 for Pn and solving for n     So Marco will reach 1000 bottles in 18 years. In the previous example, Marco’s collection grew by the same number of bottles every year. This constant change is the defining characteristic of linear growth. Plotting the values we calculated for Marco’s collection, we can see the values form a straight line, the shape of linear growth.

Linear Growth  If a quantity starts at size P0 and grows by d every time period, then the quantity after n time periods can be determined using either of these relations:  Recursive form:  Explicit form:  In this equation, represents the common difference - the amount that the population changes each time n increases by 1   Connection to Prior Learning  You may recognize the common difference, d, in our linear equation as slope. In fact, the entire explicit equation should look familiar - it is the same linear equation you learned in algebra, probably stated as .  In the standard algebraic equation , was the y-intercept, or the y value when x was zero. In the form of the equation we’re using, we are using to represent that initial amount.  In the equation, recall that m was the slope. You might remember this as “rise over run”, or the change in y divided by the change in x. Either way, it represents the same thing as the common difference, , we are using - the amount the output Pn changes when the input n increases by 1.  The equations and mean the same thing and can be used the same ways, we’re just writing it somewhat differently.    The population of elk in a national forest was measured to be 12,000 in 2003, and was measured again to be 15,000 in 2007. If the population continues to grow linearly at this rate, what will the elk population be in 2014?  To begin, we need to define how we’re going to measure . Remember that is the population when , so we probably don’t want to literally use the year 0. Since we already know the population in 2003, let us define to be the year 2003. Then .  Next we need to find . Remember is the growth per time period, in this case growth per year. Between the two measurements, the population grew by , but it took 2007-2003 = 4 years to grow that much. To find the growth per year, we can divide: elk in 1 year.  Alternatively, you can use the slope formula from algebra to determine the common difference, noting that the population is the output of the formula, and time is the input.   We can now write our equation in whichever form is preferred.  Recursive form:   Explicit form:   To answer the question, we need to first note that the year 2014 will be , since 2014 is 11 years after 2003. The explicit form will be easier to use for this calculation:  elk     Gasoline consumption in the US has been increasing steadily. Consumption data from 1992 to 2004 is shown below  Find a model for this data, and use it to predict consumption in 2016. If the trend continues, when will consumption reach 200 billion gallons?   Gas Consumption (1992 - 2004)    Year  Consumption (billions of gallons    1992  110    1993  111    1994  113    1995  116    1996  118    1997  119    1998  123    1999  125    2000  126    2001  128    2002  131    2003  133    2004  136     Plotting this data, it appears to have an approximately linear relationship:   Image Credit: RRCC   A graph containing the points: (1992, 110) (1993, 111) (1994, 113) (1995, 116) (1996, 118) (1997, 119) (1998, 123) (1999, 125) (2000, 126) (2001, 128) (2002, 131) (2003, 133) and (2004, 136). These points lie in a nearly straight line.     While there are more advanced statistical techniques that can be used to find an equation to model the data, to get an idea of what is happening, we can find an equation by using two pieces of the data - perhaps the data from 1993 and 2003.  Letting correspond with 1993 would give billion gallons.  To find , we need to know how much the gas consumption increased each year, on average. From 1993 to 2003 the gas consumption increased from 111 billion gallons to 133 billion gallons, a total change of billion gallons, over 10 years. This gives us an average change of billion gallons per year.  Equivalently,   We can now write our equation in whichever form is preferred.  Recursive form:   Explicit form:  Calculating values using the explicit form and plotting them with the original data shows how well our model fits the data.   Image Credit: RRCC   When the line found, P = 111+ 2.2n is graphed with the data points, it does not line up perfectly, but fits the data closely.     We can now use our model to make predictions about the future, assuming that the previous trend continues unchanged. To predict the gasoline consumption in 2016:  (2016 - 1993 = 23 years later)   Our model predicts that the US will consume 161.6 billion gallons of gasoline in 2016 if the current trend continues.  To find when the consumption will reach 200 billion gallons, we would set , and solve for n:     This tells us that consumption will reach 200 billion about 40 years after 1993, which would be in the year 2033.    The cost, in dollars, of a gym membership for n months can be described by the explicit equation . What does this equation tell us?  The value for in this equation is 70, so the initial starting cost is $70. This tells us that there must be an initiation or start-up fee of $70 to join the gym.  The value for in the equation is 30, so the cost increases by $30 each month. This tells us that the monthly membership fee for the gym is $30 a month.   Try It Now  The number of stay-at-home fathers in Canada has been growing steadily. While the trend is not perfectly linear, it is fairly linear. Use the data from 1976 and 2010 to find an explicit formula for the number of stay-at-home fathers, then use it to predict the number if 2020.   Number of Stay-at-Home Fathers    Year  Number of stay-at-home fathers    1976  20,610    1984  28,725    1991  43,530    2000  47,665    2010  53,555       When good models go bad  When using mathematical models to predict future behavior, it is important to keep in mind that very few trends will continue indefinitely.    Suppose a four year old boy is currently 39 inches tall, and you are told to expect him to grow 2.5 inches a year.  We can set up a growth model, with corresponding to 4 years old.  Recursive form:   Explicit form:   So at 6 years old, we would expect him to be inches tall.  Any mathematical model will break down eventually. Certainly, we shouldn’t expect this boy to continue to grow at the same rate all his life. If he did, at age 50 he would be inches tall = 12.8 feet tall!   When using any mathematical model, we have to consider which inputs are reasonable to use. Whenever we extrapolate, or make predictions into the future, we are assuming the model will continue to be valid.  "

These points lie in a nearly straight line.     While there are more advanced statistical techniques that can be used to find an equation to model the data, to get an idea of what is happening, we can find an equation by using two pieces of the data - perhaps the data from 1993 and 2003.  Letting correspond with 1993 would give billion gallons.  To find , we need to know how much the gas consumption increased each year, on average. From 1993 to 2003 the gas consumption increased from 111 billion gallons to 133 billion gallons, a total change of billion gallons, over 10 years. This gives us an average change of billion gallons per year.  Equivalently,   We can now write our equation in whichever form is preferred.  Recursive form:   Explicit form:  Calculating values using the explicit form and plotting them with the original data shows how well our model fits the data.   Image Credit: RRCC   When the line found, P = 111+ 2.2n is graphed with the data points, it does not line up perfectly, but fits the data closely.     We can now use our model to make predictions about the future, assuming that the previous trend continues unchanged. To predict the gasoline consumption in 2016:  (2016 - 1993 = 23 years later)   Our model predicts that the US will consume 161.6 billion gallons of gasoline in 2016 if the current trend continues.  To find when the consumption will reach 200 billion gallons, we would set , and solve for n:     This tells us that consumption will reach 200 billion about 40 years after 1993, which would be in the year 2033.

  "body": " Exponential Growth    Create recursive and explicit exponential models  Graph exponential models  Apply exponential models to real world applications    Suppose that every year, only 10% of the fish in a lake have surviving offspring. If there were 100 fish in the lake last year, there would now be 110 fish. If there were 1000 fish in the lake last year, there would now be 1100 fish. Absent any inhibiting factors, populations of people and animals tend to grow by a percent of the existing population each year.  Suppose our lake began with 1000 fish, and 10% of the fish have surviving offspring each year. Since we start with 1000 fish, . How do we calculate ? The new population will be the old population, plus an additional 10%. Symbolically:   Notice this could be condensed to a shorter form by factoring:   While 10% is the growth rate, 1.10 is the growth multiplier. Notice that 1.10 can be thought of as “the original 100% plus an additional 10%”  For our fish population,   We could then calculate the population in later years:    Notice that in the first year, the population grew by 100 fish, in the second year, the population grew by 110 fish, and in the third year the population grew by 121 fish. While there is a constant percentage growth, the actual increase in number of fish is increasing each year.  Graphing these values we see that this growth doesn’t quite appear linear.   Image Credit: RRCC   The points do not lie in a straight line--instead they are growing at an increasing rate.     To get a better picture of how this percentagebased growth affects things, we need an explicit form, so we can quickly calculate values further out in the future.  Like we did for the linear model, we will start building from the recursive equation:      Observing a pattern, we can generalize the explicit form to be:  , or equivalently,  From this, we can quickly calculate the number of fish in 10, 20, or 30 years:     Adding these values to our graph reveals a shape that is definitely not linear. If our fish population had been growing linearly, by 100 fish each year, the population would have only reached 4000 in 30 years compared to almost 18000 with this percent-based growth, called exponential growth.   Image Credit: RRCC   On a larger scale, the graph does not look linear. Instead it is curving upward, as the values are increasing at faster rates.     In exponential growth, the population grows proportional to the size of the population, so as the population gets larger, the same percent growth will yield a larger numeric growth.  Exponential Growth  If a quantity starts at size and grows by (written as a decimal, ) every time period, then the quantity after time periods can be determined using either of these relations:  Recursive form:   Explicit form:   We call the growth rate .  The term is called the growth multiplier , or common ratio.    Between 2007 and 2008, Olympia, WA grew almost 3% to a population of 245 thousand people. If this growth rate was to continue, what would the population of Olympia be in 2014?  As we did before, we first need to define what year will correspond to . Since we know the population in 2008, it would make sense to have 2008 correspond to , so . The year 2014 would then be .  We know the growth rate is 3%, giving .  Using the explicit form:   The model predicts that in 2014, Olympia would have a population of about 293 thousand people.    Evaluating Exponents on the Calculator  To evaluate expressions like , it will be easier to use a calculator than multiply 1.03 by itself six times. Most scientific calculators have a button for exponents. It is typically either labeled like:  ^ , , or  To evaluate 1.036 we’d type 1.03  ^  6 . Try it out - you should get an answer around 1.1940523.   Try It Now  India is the second most populous country in the world, with a population in 2008 of about 1.14 billion people. The population is growing by about 1.34% each year. If this trend continues, what will India’s population grow to by 2020?  Using corresponding with 2008, = about 1.337 billion people in 2020    A friend is using the equation to predict the annual tuition at a local college. She says the formula is based on years after 2010. What does this equation tell us?  In the equation, , which is the starting value of the tuition when . This tells us that the tuition in 2010 was $4,600.  The growth multiplier is 1.072, so the growth rate is 0.072, or 7.2%. This tells us that the tuition is expected to grow by 7.2% each year.  Putting this together, we could say that the tuition in 2010 was $4,600, and is expected to grow by 7.2% each year.     In 1990, the residential energy use in the US was responsible for 962 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. By the year 2000, that number had risen to 1182 million metric tons. If the emissions grow exponentially and continue at the same rate, what will the emissions grow to by 2050?  Similar to before, we will correspond with 1990, as that is the year for the first piece of data we have. That will make (million metric tons of CO2). In this problem, we are not given the growth rate, but instead are given that .  When , the explicit equation looks like:   We know the value for , so we can put that into the equation:   We also know that , so substituting that in, we get   We can now solve this equation for the growth rate, r. Start by dividing by 962.   Then take the 10th root of both sides:   Finally subtract 1 from both sides    So if the emissions are growing exponentially, they are growing by about 2.08% per year. We can now predict the emissions in 2050 by finding  million metric tons of CO2 in 2050    Rounding  As a note on rounding, notice that if we had rounded the growth rate to 2.1%, our calculation for the emissions in 2050 would have been 3347. Rounding to 2% would have changed our result to 3156. A very small difference in the growth rates gets magnified greatly in exponential growth. For this reason, it is recommended to round the growth rate as little as possible.  If you need to round, keep at least three significant digits - numbers after any leading zeros. So 0.4162 could be reasonably rounded to 0.416. A growth rate of 0.001027 could be reasonably rounded to 0.00103.   Evaluating Roots on the calculator  In the previous example, we had to calculate the 10th root of a number. This is different than taking the basic square root, . Many scientific calculators have a button for general roots. It is typically labeled like:  , , or  To evaluate the 3rd root of 8, for example, we’d either type 3 8, or 8 3, depending on the calculator. Try it on yours to see which to use - you should get an answer of 2.  If your calculator does not have a general root button, all is not lost. You can instead use the property of exponents which states that  So, to compute the 3rd root of 8, you could use your calculator’s exponent key to evaluate . To do this, type:  8 ^ (1\/3)  The parentheses tell the calculator to divide 1\/3 before doing the exponent.   Try It Now  The number of users on a social networking site was 45 thousand in February when they officially went public, and grew to 60 thousand by October. If the site is growing exponentially, and growth continues at the same rate, how many users should they expect two years after they went public?  106.63 thousand users   Here we will measure n in months rather than years, with corresponding to the February when they went public. This gives thousand. October is 8 months later, so thousand.   Divide both sides by 45:   Take the 8th root of both sides:     Since r = 0.0366, or 3.66%, the general explicit equation is   Predicting 24 months (2 years) after they went public:      Looking back at the last example, for the sake of comparison, what would the carbon emissions be in 2050 if emissions grow linearly at the same rate?  Again we will get correspond with 1990, giving . To find , we could take the same approach as earlier, noting that the emissions increased by 220 million metric tons in 10 years, giving a common difference of 22 million metric tons each year.  Alternatively, we could use an approach similar to that which we used to find the exponential equation. When , the explicit linear equation looks like:   We know the value for , so we can put that into the equation:   Since we know that , substituting that in we get   We can now solve this equation for the common difference, d.     This tells us that if the emissions are changing linearly, they are growing by 22 million metric tons each year.  Predicting the emissions in 2050, million metric tons.  You will notice that this number is substantially smaller than the prediction from the exponential growth model. Calculating and plotting more values helps illustrate the differences.   Image Credit: RRCC   The linear and exponential models are closer together when n is small. But as n gets larger, it becomes clear that the exponential function is growing at a faster rate.       So how do we know which growth model to use when working with data? There are two approaches which should be used together whenever possible:    Find more than two pieces of data. Plot the values, and look for a trend. Does the data appear to be changing like a line, or do the values appear to be curving upwards?  Consider the factors contributing to the data. Are they things you would expect to change linearly or exponentially? For example, in the case of carbon emissions, we could expect that, absent other factors, they would be tied closely to population values, which tend to change exponentially.    "

The position offers 16% commission on her sales. Her earnings depend on the amount of her sales. For instance, if she sells a vehicle for $4,600, she will earn $736. She wants to evaluate the offer, but she is not sure how. In this section, we will look at relationships, such as this one, between earnings, sales, and commission rate.   Solving Direct Variation Problems  In the example above, Nicole’s earnings can be found by multiplying her sales by her commission. The formula tells us her earnings, , come from the product of 0.16, her commission, and the sale price of the vehicle. If we create a table, we observe that as the sales price increases, the earnings increase as well, which should be intuitive.     Sales Price   Interpretation    $4,600   A sale of a $4,600 vehicle results in $736 earnings.    $9,200   A sale of a $9,200 vehicle results in $1472 earnings.    $18,400   A sale of a $18,400 vehicle results in $2944 earnings.     Notice that earnings are a multiple of sales. As sales increase, earnings increase in a predictable way. Double the sales of the vehicle from $4,600 to $9,200, and we double the earnings from $736 to $1,472. As the input increases, the output increases as a multiple of the input. A relationship in which one quantity is a constant multiplied by another quantity is called direct variation. Each variable in this type of relationship varies directly with the other.  The figure below represents the data for Nicole’s potential earnings. We say that earnings vary directly with the sales price of the car. The formula is used for direct variation. The value is a nonzero constant greater than zero and is called the constant of variation. In this case, and .  Direct Variation  If and are related by an equation of the form   then we say that the relationship is direct variation and varies directly with, or is proportional to, the nth power of . In direct variation relationships, there is a nonzero constant ratio , where is called the constant of variation , which help defines the relationship between the variables.   How To Solve Direct Variation Problems  Given a description of a direct variation problem, solve for an unknown.    Identify the input, , and the output, .  Determine the constant of variation. You may need to divide by the specified power of to determine the constant of variation.  Use the constant of variation to write an equation for the relationship.

Solving Inverse Variation Prolblems  Water temperature in an ocean varies inversely to the water’s depth. The formula gives us the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at a depth in feet below Earth’s surface. Consider the Atlantic Ocean, which covers 22% of Earth’s surface. At a certain location, at the depth of 500 feet, the temperature may be 28°F.  If we create the table below, we observe that, as the depth increases, the water temperature decreases.     Depth   Interpretation    500 ft   At a depth of 500 ft, the water temperature is    1000 ft   At a depth of 1,000 ft, the water temperature is    2000 ft   At a depth of 2,000 ft, the water temperature is     We notice in the relationship between these variables that, as one quantity increases, the other decreases. The two quantities are said to be inversely proportional and each term varies inversely with the other. Inversely proportional relationships are also called inverse variations.  For our example, the figure depicts the inverse variation. We say the water temperature varies inversely with the depth of the water because, as the depth increases, the temperature decreases. The formula for inverse variation in this case uses .  Inverse Variation  If and are related by an equation of the form, where is a nonzero constant, then we say that  varies inversely with the nth power of . In inversely proportional relationships, or inverse variations, there is a constant multiple .    The quantity varies inversely with the square . If when , find when is 4.  The general formula for this inverse variation is   First plug-in and and solve for .      Now use the constant to write an equation that represents this relationship.   Substitute and solve for .        The volume of a gas held at constant temperature varies inversely as the pressure of the gas. If the volume of a gas is 1200 cubic centimeters when the pressure is 200 millimeters of mercury, what is the volume when the pressure is 300 millimeters of mercury?   We can expression the fact that \"volume varies inversely as pressure\" with the equation,   Use the when to solve for :     We can write the relationship, and plug in to find the volume when pressure is 300 millimeters of mercury.

A new truck costs $32,000. The car’s value will depreciate over time, which means it will lose value. For tax purposes, depreciation is usually calculated linearly. If the truck is worth $24,500 after three years, write an explicit formula for the value of the car after n years.  Inflation causes things to cost more, and for our money to buy less (hence your grandparents saying, \"In my day, you could buy a cup of coffee for a nickel\"). Suppose inflation decreases the value of money by 5% each year. In other words, if you have $1 this year, next year it will only buy you $0.95 worth of stuff. How much will $100 buy you in 20 years?

  "title": "Simple and Compound Interest",
  "body": "Simple and Compound Interest  Simple Interest    Set up and solve simple interest problems  Set up and solve compound interest problems  Compare simple and compound interest    Discussing interest starts with the principal , or amount your account starts with. This could be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. Interest, in its most simple form, is calculated as a percent of the principal.  For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would just be 5% of 100: $100(0.05) = $5. The total amount you would repay would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.  Simple One-time Interest  Simple interest can be computed with:  where,  I is the interest  A is the end amount: principal plus interest  is the principal (starting amount)  r is the interest rate (in decimal form. Example: 5% = 0.05)    A friend asks to borrow $300 and agrees to repay it in 30 days with 3% interest. How much interest will you earn?   (the principal)  (3% interest rate)   You will earn $9 interest.    One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term loans. For longer term loans, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In that case, interest would be earned regularly. For example, bonds are essentially a loan made to the bond issuer (a company or government) by you, the bond holder. In return for the loan, the issuer agrees to pay interest, often annually. Bonds have a maturity date, at which time the issuer pays back the original bond value.  Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You obtain a $1,000 bond that pays 5% interest annually that matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn?  Each year, you would earn 5% interest: $1000(0.05) = $50 in interest. So over the course of five years, you would earn a total of $250 in interest. When the bond matures, you would receive back the $1,000 you originally paid, leaving you with a total of $1,250.    We can generalize this idea of simple interest over time.  Simple Interest over Time  To compute simple sinterest over time,  where,  I is the interest  A is the end amount: principal plus interest  is the principal (starting amount)  r is the interest rate in decimal form  t is time  The units of measurement (years, months, etc.) for the time should match the time period for the interest rate.   APR - Annual Percentage Rate  Interest rates are usually given as an annual percentage rate (APR) - the total interest that will be paid in the year. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will be divided up.  For example, a 6% APR paid monthly would be divided into twelve 0.5% payments. A 4% annual rate paid quarterly would be divided into four 1% payments.    Treasury Notes (T-notes) are bonds issued by the federal government to cover its expenses. Suppose you obtain a $1,000 T-note with a 4% annual rate, paid semi-annually, with a maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn?  Since interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), the 4% interest will be divided into two 2% payments.  the principal  2% rate per half-year  4 years = 8 half-years   You will earn $160 interest total over the four years.    Try It Now  A loan company charges $30 interest for a one month loan of $500. Find the annual interest rate they are charging.  72% interest  Using , we get . Solving, we get r = 0.06, or 6%. Since the time was monthly, this is the monthly interest. The annual rate would be 12 times this: 72% interest.    Compound Interest  With simple interest, we were assuming that we pocketed the interest when we received it. In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest in future years. This reinvestment of interest is called compounding.  Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?  The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) - the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn 12 %3 = 0.25% per month.  In the first month,   In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.  In the second month,   Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding of interest gives us.  Table does this computation for a few more months.     Month  Starting Balance  Interest Earned  Ending Balance    1  1000  2.50  1002.50    2  1002.50  2.51  1005.01    3  1005.01  2.51  1007.52    4  1007.52  2.52  1010.04    5  1010.04  2.53  1012.57  z  6  1012.57  2.53  1015.10    7  1015.10  2.54  1017.64    8  1017.54  2.54  1020.18    9  1020.18  2.55  1022.73    10  1022.73  2.56  1025.29    11  1025.29  2.56  1027.85    12  1027.85  2.57  1030.42     To find an equation to represent this, if Pm represents the amount of money after m months, then we could write the recursive equation:    You probably recognize this as the recursive form of exponential growth. If not, we could go through the steps to build an explicit equation for the growth:   Observing a pattern, we could conclude   Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P0, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the growth rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year. Generalizing our result, we could write   In this formula:  is the number of compounding periods (months in our example)  is the annual interest rate  is the number of compounds per year.  While this formula works fine, it is more common to use a formula that involves the number of years, rather than the number of compounding periods. If is the number of years, then . Making this change gives us the standard formula for compound interest.  Compound Interest  The compound interest formula is:   is the balance in the account after years.  is the starting balance of the account (also called initial deposit, or principal)  is the annual interest rate in decimal form  is the number of compounding periods in one year.   If the compounding is done annually (once a year), .  If the compounding is done quarterly, .  If the compounding is done monthly, .  If the compounding is done daily, .  The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.   A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer. It usually gives a higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time. Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% interest, compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 20 years?   In this example,  (the initial deposit)  (6% annual rate)  (12 months in 1 year)  (since we’re looking for how much we’ll have after 20 years)     Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding against the amount you would earn from simple interest.     Years  Simple Interest ($15\/month)  6% Compound Monthly    5  $3900  $4046.55    10  $4800  $5458.19    15  $5700  $7362.28    20  $6600  $9930.61    25  $7500  $13,394.91    30  $8400  $18,067.73    35  $9300  $24,370.65       Image Credit: RRCC  Values of the account over time are plotted. When there is simple interest, the graph is linear. If the interested is compounded the graph is exponential.     As you can see, over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.  Evaluating exponents on the calculator  When we need to calculate something like it is easy enough to just multiply . But when we need to calculate something like , it would be very tedious to calculate this by multiplying 1.005 by itself 240 times! So to make things easier, we can harness the power of our scientific calculators.  Most scientific calculators have a button for exponents. It is typically either labeled like:   ^ , , or  To evaluate we'd type 1.005  ^  240 . Try it out - you should get something around 3.3102044758.    You know that you will need $40,000 for your child’s education in 18 years. If your account earns 4% compounded quarterly, how much would you need to deposit now to reach your goal?  In this example, we’re looking for .   (4 quarters in 1 year)    In this case, we’re going to have to set up the equation, and solve for .   So you would need to deposit $19,539.84 now to have $40,000 in 18 years.    Rounding  It is important to be very careful about rounding when calculating things with exponents. In general, you want to keep as many decimals during calculations as you can. Be sure to keep at least 3 significant digits (numbers after any leading zeros). Rounding 0.00012345 to 0.000123 will usually give you a “close enough” answer, but keeping more digits is always better.    To see why not over-rounding is so important, suppose you were investing $1000 at 5% interest compounded monthly for 30 years.   Here is the effect of rounding this to different values:     r\/k rounded to:  Gives to be:  Error    0.004  $4208.59  $259.15    0.0042  $4521.45  $53.71    0.00417  $4473.09  $5.35    0.004167  $4468.28  $0.54    0.0041667  $4467.80  $0.06    no rounding  $4467.74      If you’re working in a bank, of course you wouldn’t round at all.

Certainly keeping that fourth decimal place wouldn’t have hurt.   Using your Calculator  In many cases, you can avoid rounding completely by how you enter things in your calculator.

  "body": " Annuities    Solve applications involving annuities    For most of us, we aren’t able to put a large sum of money in the bank today. Instead, we save for the future by depositing a smaller amount of money from each paycheck into the bank. This idea is called a savings annuity. Most retirement plans like 401k plans or IRA plans are examples of savings annuities.  An annuity can be described recursively in a fairly simple way. Recall that basic compound interest follows from the relationship   For a savings annuity, we simply need to add a deposit, , to the account with each compounding period:   Taking this equation from recursive form to explicit form is a bit trickier than with compound interest. It will be easiest to see by working with an example rather than working in general.  Suppose we will deposit $100 each month into an account paying 6% interest. We assume that the account is compounded with the same frequency as we make deposits unless stated otherwise. In this example:  (6%)  (12 compounds\/deposits per year)  (our deposit per month)  Writing out the recursive equation gives   Assuming we start with an empty account, we can begin using this relationship:   Continuing this pattern, after m deposits, we’d have saved:   In other words, after months, the first deposit will have earned compound interest for months. The second deposit will have earned interest for months. Last months deposit would have earned only one month worth of interest. The most recent deposit will have earned no interest yet.  This equation leaves a lot to be desired, though - it doesn’t make calculating the ending balance any easier! To simplify things, multiply both sides of the equation by 1.005, and distribute on on the right side of the equation:   Now we’ll line this up with like terms from our original equation, and subtract each side   Almost all the terms cancel on the right hand side when we subtract, leaving   Solving for    Replacing months with , where is measured in years, gives   Recall 0.005 was r\/k and 100 was the deposit d. 12 was k, the number of deposit each year. Generalizing this result, we get the saving annuity formula.  Annuity Formula  To compute the value of an annutiy after years,   is the balance in the account after years.  is the regular deposit (the amount you deposit each year, each month, etc.)  is the annual interest rate in decimal form.  is the number of compounding periods in one year.  If the compounding frequency is not explicitly stated, assume there are the same number of compounds in a year as there are deposits made in a year.   For example, if the compounding frequency isn’t stated:  If you make your deposits every month, use monthly compounding, k = 12.  If you make your deposits every year, use yearly compounding, k = 1, etc.  When do you use this?  Annuities assume that you put money in the account on a regular schedule (every month, year, quarter, etc.) and let it sit there earning interest.  Compound interest assumes that you put money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.  Compound interest: One deposit  Annuity: Many deposits.    A traditional individual retirement account (IRA) is a special type of retirement account in which the money you invest is exempt from income taxes until you withdraw it. If you deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% interest, how much will you have in the account after 20 years?  In this example,   Putting this into the equation:      The account will grow to $46,200 after 20 years.  Notice that you deposited into the account a total of $24,000 ($100 a month for 240 months). The difference between what you end up with and how much you put in is the interest earned. In this case it is $46,200 - $24,000 = $22,200.     You want to have $200,000 in your account when you retire in 30 years. Your retirement account earns 8% interest. How much do you need to deposit each month to meet your retirement goal?  In this example, we are looking for .   In this case, we’re going to have to set up the equation, and solve for d.

  "body": "Payout Annuities    Solve applications involving payout annuities    In the last section you learned about annuities. In an annuity, you start with nothing, put money into an account on a regular basis, and end up with money in your account.  In this section, we will learn about a variation called a Payout Annuity. With a payout annuity, you start with money in the account, and pull money out of the account on a regular basis. Any remaining money in the account earns interest. After a fixed amount of time, the account will end up empty.  Payout annuities are typically used after retirement. Perhaps you have saved $500,000 for retirement, and want to take money out of the account each month to live on. You want the money to last you 20 years. This is a payout annuity. The formula is derived in a similar way as we did for savings annuities. The details are omitted here.  Payout Annuity Formula  To compute the balance at the beginning of a payout annuity with regular withdrawals of d,   is the balance in the account at the beginning (starting amount, or principal).  is the regular withdrawal (the amount you take out each year, each month, etc.)  is the annual interest rate (in decimal form. Example: 5% = 0.05)  is the number of compounding periods in one year.  is the number of years we plan to take withdrawals   Like with annuities, the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is determined by how often you take the withdrawals.  When do you use this?  Payout annuities assume that you take money from the account on a regular schedule (every month, year, quarter, etc.) and let the rest sit there earning interest.  Compound interest: One deposit  Annuity: Many deposits.  Payout Annuity: Many withdrawals    After retiring, you want to be able to take $1000 every month for a total of 20 years from your retirement account. The account earns 6% interest. How much will you need in your account when you retire?   In this example,   We’re looking for ; how much money needs to be in the account at the beginning. Putting this into the equation:     You will need to have $139,600 in your account when you retire.  Notice that you withdrew a total of $240,000 ($1000 a month for 240 months). The difference between what you pulled out and what you started with is the interest earned. In this case it is $240,000 - $139,600 = $100,400 in interest.    Evaluating negative exponents on your calculator  With these problems, you need to raise numbers to negative powers. Most calculators have a separate button for negating a number that is different than the subtraction button. Some calculators label this (-) , some with +\/- . The button is often near the = key or the decimal point.  If your calculator displays operations on it (typically a calculator with multiline display), to calculate you'd type something like: 1.005 ^  (-) 240  If your calculator only shows one value at a time, then usually you hit the (-) key after a number to negate it, so you'd hit: 1.005 ^ 240 (-)  =  Give it a try - you should get    You know you will have $500,000 in your account when you retire. You want to be able to take monthly withdrawals from the account for a total of 30 years. Your retirement account earns 8% interest. How much will you be able to withdraw each month?   In this example, we’re looking for d.   In this case, we’re going to have to set up the equation, and solve for d.      You would be able to withdraw $3,670.21 each month for 30 years.    Try It Now  A donor gives $100,000 to a university, and specifies that it is to be used to give annual scholarships for the next 20 years. If the university can earn 4% interest, how much can they give in scholarships each year?  Solving for d gives $7,358.18 each year that they can give in scholarships.  It is worth noting that usually donors instead specify that only interest is to be used for scholarship, which makes the original donation last indefinitely. If this donor had specified that, $100,000(0.04) = $4,000 a year would have been available.    "

  "title": "Loans",
  "body": "Loans    Solve applications involving amortized loans  Create amortization schedules  Compute the remaining loan balance    In the last section, you learned about payout annuities. In this section, you will learn about conventional loans (also called amortized loans or installment loans). Examples include auto loans and home mortgages. These techniques do not apply to payday loans, add-on loans, or other loan types where the interest is calculated up front.  Loans  One great thing about loans is that they use exactly the same formula as a payout annuity. To see why, imagine that you had $10,000 invested at a bank, and started taking out payments while earning interest as part of a payout annuity, and after 5 years your balance was zero. Flip that around, and imagine that you are acting as the bank, and a car lender is acting as you. The car lender invests $10,000 in you. Since you’re acting as the bank, you pay interest. The car lender takes payments until the balance is zero.  Loans Formula  The loans formula is   is the balance in the account at the beginning (the principal, or amount of the loan).  is your loan payment (your monthly payment, annual payment, etc)  is the annual interest rate in decimal form.  is the number of compounding periods in one year.  is the length of the loan, in years   Like before, the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is determined by how often you make payments.  When do you use this?  The loan formula assumes that you make loan payments on a regular schedule (every month, year, quarter, etc.) and are paying interest on the loan.  Compound interest: One deposit  Annuity: Many deposits.  Payout Annuity: Many withdrawals  Loans: Many payments    You can afford $200 per month as a car payment. If you can get an auto loan at 3% interest for 60 months (5 years), how expensive of a car can you afford? In other words, what amount loan can you pay off with $200 per month?   In this example,  the monthly loan payment  3% annual rate  since we’re doing monthly payments, we’ll compound monthly  since we’re making monthly payments for 5 years  We’re looking for , the starting amount of the loan.     You can afford a $11,120 loan.  You will pay a total of $12,000 ($200 per month for 60 months) to the loan company. The difference between the amount you pay and the amount of the loan is the interest paid. In this case, you’re paying $12,000-$11,120 = $880 interest total.     You want to take out a $140,000 mortgage (home loan). The interest rate on the loan is 6%, and the loan is for 30 years. How much will your monthly payments be?  In this example, we’re looking for d.  6% annual rate  since we’re paying monthly  30 years  the starting loan amount  In this case, we’re going to have to set up the equation, and solve for d.      You will make payments of $839.37 per month for 30 years.  You’re paying a total of $302,173.20 to the loan company: $839.37 per month for 360 months. You are paying a total of $302,173.20 - $140,000 = $162,173.20 in interest over the life of the loan.    Try It Now  Janine bought $3,000 of new furniture on credit. Because her credit score isn’t very good, the store is charging her a fairly high interest rate on the loan: 16%. If she agreed to pay off the furniture over 2 years, how much will she have to pay each month?  Solving for d gives $146.89 as monthly payments.  In total, she will pay $3,525.36 to the store, meaning she will pay $525.36 in interest over the two years.     Amortization Schedules  Consider a 5-year loan for $10,000 with yearly payments. If the interest rate is 12%, we can compute the yearly payments. But how much interest are we paying each year? How much of our payments are going toward the principal of the loan?  We can create a table, also called an amortization schedule to show how the interest is spread out over the payments of the loan.  First, using the loans formula, we can solve for , or the amount of each payment.      We will make 5 annual payments of $2,774.08. That means, we are paying a total of to pay off this loan. Since we borrowed $10,000, the difference is interest. $13,870.40 - $10,000 = $3,870.40.  Since we owe more money at the beginning of the loan, we should expect to pay more interest in beginning. We can see how this works in Table below.     Payment  Amount of Payment  Interest  Paid to Principal  New Balance    1  $2,774.08  $1,200  $1,574.08  $8,425.92    2  $2,774.08  $1,011.11  $1,762.97  $6,662.95    3  $2,774.08  $799.55  $1,974.53  $4,688.42    4  $2,774.08  $562.61  $2,211.47  $2,476.95    5  $2,774.08  $297.23  $2,476.85  $0.10     Before we make our first payment, we owe $10,000. We will pay 12% annual interest on that amount: which is $1,200. That means $1,200 of our first payment is interest. The rest of the $2,774.08 will go toward the principal of the loan.  Since $2,774.08 - $1,200 = $1,574.08, the balance (or principal) of the loan will be reduced by $1,574.08  After our first payment, the balance of the loan is $10,000 - $1,574.08 = $8,425.92  This information is summarized in the first row of the amortization schedule in .  To determine the interest in that second payment, we have to take 12% of the new balance ($8.425.92):   In the second payment, $2,774.08 - $1,011.11 = $1,762.97 will reduce the balance of the loan. That means, the balance of the loan after the second payment is: $8.425.92 - $1,792.97 = $6,662.95  To find the interest in the third payment we can take 12% of this new balance--$6,662.95.  We can continue this pattern to complete the rest of the table.  The remaining balance of 10 cents at the end of the loan is a result of rounding that was used to compute the loan payments. A lender wouldn't actually do any rounding, and the entire balance of the loan would be paid off at the end of the 5 years.  Create the first two lines of an amortization schedule for a 30-year mortgage for $150,000 at 6% interest with monthly payments.  First we need to find the amount of the monthly payment (or d) using our loans formula:      Now we can compute the amount of interest owed during that first month of the loan. Using our simple interest formula,     Recall, that is measured in years. One month = year.  This means $750 of our first payment is interest. The rest, $899.32 - $750 = $149.32, will go toward the balance of the loan.  The new balance of the loan can be obtained by subtracting $149.32 from $150,000 to get $149,850.68.  The first line of the amortization schedule is:     Payment  Amount of Payment  Interest  Paid to Principal  New Balance    1  $899.32  $750  $149.32  $149,850.68     Now we repeat the process to fill out the second line of table. To compute the amount of interest owed during the second month of the loan, we can use the simple interest formula,     Notice that we still year for because we are interested in the interest that we owe over one month (specifically the second month) of the loan.  This means $749.25 of our second payment is interest. The rest, $899.32 - $749.25 = $150.07, will go toward the balance of the loan.  The new balance of the loan can be obtained by subtracting $150.07 from $149,850.68 to get $149,700.61.  Now we have the first two lines of the amortization schedule in the table.     Payment  Amount of Payment  Interest  Paid to Principal  New Balance    1  $899.32  $750  $149.32  $149,850.68    2  $899.32  $749.25  $150.07  $149,700.61        Remaining Loan Balance  With loans, it is often desirable to determine what the remaining loan balance will be after some number of years. For example, if you purchase a home and plan to sell it in five years, you might want to know how much of the loan balance you will have paid off and how much you have to pay from the sale.  To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to know the loan payments, if we don’t already know them. Remember that only a portion of your loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will not have paid off $12,000 of the loan balance.  To determine the remaining loan balance, we can think “how much loan will these loan payments be able to pay off in the remaining time on the loan?”   If a mortgage at a 6% interest rate has payments of $1,000 a month, how much will the loan balance be 10 years from the end the loan?   To determine this, we are looking for the amount of the loan that can be paid off by $1,000 a month payments in 10 years. In other words, we’re looking for when  the monthly loan payment  6% annual rate  since we’re doing monthly payments, we’ll compound monthly  since we’re making monthly payments for 10 more years     The loan balance with 10 years remaining on the loan will be $90,073.45    Often times answering remaining balance questions requires two steps:  Calculating the monthly payments on the loan  Calculating the remaining loan balance based on the remaining time on the loan     A couple purchases a home with a $180,000 mortgage at 4% for 30 years with monthly payments. What will the remaining balance on their mortgage be after 5 years?  First we will calculate their monthly payments. We’re looking for d.  4% annual rate  since they’re paying monthly  years  the starting loan amount  We set up the equation and solve for d.      Now that we know the monthly payments, we can determine the remaining balance. We want the remaining balance after 5 years, when 25 years will be remaining on the loan, so we calculate the loan balance that will be paid off with the monthly payments over those 25 years.  the monthly loan payment we calculated above  4% annual rate  since they’re doing monthly payments  since they'd be making monthly payments for 25 more years     The loan balance after 5 years, with 25 years remaining on the loan, will be $162,758  Over that 5 years, the couple has paid off $180,000 - $162,758 = $17,242 of the loan balance. They have paid a total of $858.93 a month for 5 years (60 months), for a total of $51,535.80, so $51,535.80 - $17,242 = $34,292.80 of what they have paid so far has been interest.     Which Equation to Use?  When presented with a finance problem (on an exam or in real life), you're usually not told what type of problem it is or which equation to use. Here are some hints on deciding which equation to use based on the wording of the problem.  The easiest types of problem to identify are loans. Loan problems almost always include words like: \"loan\", \"amortize\" (the fancy word for loans), \"finance (a car)\", or \"mortgage\" (a home loan). Look for these words. If they're there, you're probably looking at a loan problem. To make sure, see if you're given what your monthly (or annual) payment is, or if you're trying to find a monthly payment.  If the problem is not a loan, the next question you want to ask is: \"Am I putting money in an account and letting it sit, or am I making regular (monthly\/annually\/quarterly) payments or withdrawals?\" If you're letting the money sit in the account with nothing but interest changing the balance, then you're looking at a compound interest problem. The exception would be bonds and other investments where the interest is not reinvested; in those cases you’re looking at simple interest.  If you're making regular payments or withdrawals, the next questions is: \"Am I putting money into the account, or am I pulling money out?\" If you're putting money into the account on a regular basis (monthly\/annually\/quarterly) then you're looking at a basic Annuity problem. Basic annuities are when you are saving money. Usually in an annuity problem, your account starts empty, and has money in the future.  If you're pulling money out of the account on a regular basis, then you're looking at a Payout Annuity problem. Payout annuities are used for things like retirement income, where you start with money in your account, pull money out on a regular basis, and your account ends up empty in the future.  Remember, the most important part of answering any kind of question, money or otherwise, is first to correctly identify what the question is really asking, and to determine what approach will best allow you to solve the problem.  Try It Now  For each of the following scenarios, determine if it is a compound interest problem, a savings annuity problem, a payout annuity problem, or a loans problem. Then solve each problem.    Marcy received an inheritance of $20,000, and invested it at 6% interest. She is going to use it for college, withdrawing money for tuition and expenses each quarter. How much can she take out each quarter if she has 3 years of school left?  Paul wants to buy a new car. Rather than take out a loan, he decides to save $200 a month in an account earning 3% interest compounded monthly. How much will he have saved up after 3 years?  Keisha is managing investments for a non-profit company. They want to invest some money in an account earning 5% interest compounded annually with the goal to have $30,000 in the account in 6 years. How much should Keisha deposit into the account?  Miao is going to finance new office equipment at a 2% rate over a 4 year term. If she can afford monthly payments of $100, how much new equipment can she buy?  How much would you need to save every month in an account earning 4% interest to have $5,000 saved up in two years?       This is a payout annuity problem. She can pull out $1833.60 a quarter  This is a savings annuity problem. He will have saved up $7,524.11  This is compound interest problem. She would need to deposit $22,386.46  This is a loans problem. She can buy $4,609.33 of new equipment.  This is a savings annuity problem. You would need to save $200.46 each month       "

  "body": " A couple purchases a home with a $180,000 mortgage at 4% for 30 years with monthly payments. What will the remaining balance on their mortgage be after 5 years?  First we will calculate their monthly payments. We’re looking for d.  4% annual rate  since they’re paying monthly  years  the starting loan amount  We set up the equation and solve for d.      Now that we know the monthly payments, we can determine the remaining balance. We want the remaining balance after 5 years, when 25 years will be remaining on the loan, so we calculate the loan balance that will be paid off with the monthly payments over those 25 years.  the monthly loan payment we calculated above  4% annual rate  since they’re doing monthly payments  since they'd be making monthly payments for 25 more years     The loan balance after 5 years, with 25 years remaining on the loan, will be $162,758  Over that 5 years, the couple has paid off $180,000 - $162,758 = $17,242 of the loan balance. They have paid a total of $858.93 a month for 5 years (60 months), for a total of $51,535.80, so $51,535.80 - $17,242 = $34,292.80 of what they have paid so far has been interest.   "

Let's consider your existing mortgage:  How much money did you pay as your down payment?  How much money was your mortgage (loan) for?  What is your current monthly payment?  How much total interest will you pay over the life of the loan?    This year, you check your loan balance. Only part of your payments have been going to pay down the loan; the rest has been going towards interest. You see that you still have $88,536 left to pay on your loan. Your house is now valued at $150,000.  How much of the loan have you paid off? (i.e., how much have you reduced the loan balance by? Keep in mind that interest is charged each month - it's not part of the loan balance.)  How much money have you paid to the loan company so far?  How much interest have you paid so far?  How much equity do you have in your home (equity is value minus remaining debt)    Since interest rates have dropped, you consider refinancing your mortgage at a lower 6% rate.  If you took out a new 30 year mortgage at 6% for your remaining loan balance, what would your new monthly payments be?  How much interest will you pay over the life of the new loan?    Notice that if you refinance, you are going to be making payments on your home for another 30 years. In addition to the 10 years you've already been paying, that's 40 years total.  How much will you save each month because of the lower monthly payment?  How much total interest will you be paying?  Does it make sense to refinance? (there isn't a correct answer to this question. Just give your opinion and your reason.)     "

Partly it means being able to properly evaluate the data and claims that bombard you every day. If you cannot distinguish good from faulty reasoning, then you are vulnerable to manipulation and to decisions that are not in your best interest. Statistics provides tools that you need in order to react intelligently to information you hear or read. In this sense, Statistics is one of the most important things that you can study.  To be more specific, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are not saying that each one of these claims is true!)    4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.  Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.  Condoms are effective 94% of the time.  Native Americans are significantly more likely to be hit crossing the streets than are people of other ethnicities.  People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.  Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.  A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.  People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.  There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.  79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.    All of these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar; if not, we bet that you have heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples are; they come from psychology, health, law, sports, business, etc. Indeed, data and data-interpretation show up in discourse from virtually every facet of contemporary life.  Statistics are often presented in an effort to add credibility to an argument or advice. You can see this by paying attention to television advertisements. Many of the numbers thrown about in this way do not represent careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading, and push you into decisions that you might find cause to regret. For these reasons, learning about statistics is a long step towards taking control of your life. (It is not, of course, the only step needed for this purpose.) These chapters will help you learn statistical essentials. It will make you into an intelligent consumer of statistical claims.  You can take the first step right away. To be an intelligent consumer of statistics, your first reflex must be to question the statistics that you encounter. The British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli famously said, \"There are three kinds of lies -- lies, damned lies, and statistics.\" This quote reminds us why it is so important to understand statistics. So let us invite you to reform your statistical habits from now on. No longer will you blindly accept numbers or findings. Instead, you will begin to think about the numbers, their sources, and most importantly, the procedures used to generate them.  We have put the emphasis on defending ourselves against fraudulent claims wrapped up as statistics. Just as important as detecting the deceptive use of statistics is the appreciation of the proper use of statistics. You must also learn to recognize statistical evidence that supports a stated conclusion. When a research team is testing a new treatment for a disease, statistics allows them to conclude based on a relatively small trial that there is good evidence their drug is effective. Statistics allowed prosecutors in the 1950’s and 60’s to demonstrate racial bias existed in jury panels. Statistics are all around you, sometimes used well, sometimes not. We must learn how to distinguish the two cases.  Before we begin gathering and analyzing data we need to characterize the population we are studying. If we want to study the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical first-year college student, our population might be all first-year students at your college. Or it might be:    All first-year community college students in the state of Washington.  All first-year students at public colleges and universities in the state of Washington.  All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the state of Washington.  All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.    Population  The population of a study is the group the collected data is intended to describe.   Sometimes the intended population is called the target population, since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.  Why is it important to specify the population? We might get different answers to our question as we vary the population we are studying. First-year students at the University of Washington might take slightly more diverse courses than those at your college, and some of these courses may require less popular textbooks that cost more; or, on the other hand, the University Bookstore might have a larger pool of used textbooks, reducing the cost of these books to the students. Whichever the case (and it is likely that some combination of these and other factors are in play), the data we gather from your college will probably not be the same as that from the University of Washington. Particularly when conveying our results to others, we want to be clear about the population we are describing with our data.   A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the population?  While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.  If we were able to gather data on every member of our population, say the average (we will define \"average\" more carefully in a subsequent section) amount of money spent on textbooks by each first-year student at your college during the 2009-2010 academic year, the resulting number would be called a parameter.     Parameter  A parameter is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using all the data from a population.   We seldom see parameters, however, since surveying an entire population is usually very time-consuming and expensive, unless the population is very small or we already have the data collected.  Census  A survey of an entire population is called a census .   You are probably familiar with two common censuses: the official government Census that attempts to count the population of the U.S. every ten years, and voting, which asks the opinion of all eligible voters in a district. The first of these demonstrates one additional problem with a census: the difficulty in finding and getting participation from everyone in a large population, which can bias, or skew, the results.  There are occasionally times when a census is appropriate, usually when the population is fairly small. For example, if the manager of Starbucks wanted to know the average number of hours her employees worked last week, she should be able to pull up payroll records or ask each employee directly.  Since surveying an entire population is often impractical, we usually select a sample to study.  Sample  A sample is a smaller subset of the entire population, ideally one that is fairly representative of the whole population.   We will discuss sampling methods in greater detail in a later section. For now, let us assume that samples are chosen in an appropriate manner. If we survey a sample, say 100 first-year students at your college, and find the average amount of money spent by these students on textbooks, the resulting number is called a statistic.  Statistic  A statistic is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using the data from a sample.    A researcher wanted to know how citizens of Tacoma felt about a voter initiative. To study this, she goes to the Tacoma Mall and randomly selects 500 shoppers and asks them their opinion. 60% indicate they are supportive of the initiative. What is the sample and population? Is the 60% value a parameter or a statistic?   The sample is the 500 shoppers questioned. The population is less clear. While the intended population of this survey was Tacoma citizens, the effective population was mall shoppers. There is no reason to assume that the 500 shoppers questioned would be representative of all Tacoma citizens.  The 60% value was based on the sample, so it is a statistic.    Try It Now  To determine the average length of trout in a lake, researchers catch 20 fish and measure them. What is the sample and population in this study?  The sample is the 20 fish caught. The population is all fish in the lake. The sample may be somewhat unrepresentative of the population since not all fish may be large enough to catch the bait.   Try It Now  A college reports that the average age of their students is 28 years old. Is this a statistic or a parameter?  This is a parameter, since the college would have access to data on all students (the population).   Once we have gathered data, we might wish to classify it. Roughly speaking, data can be classified as categorical data or quantitative data.  Quantitative and Categorical Data  Categorical (qualitative) data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the objects under investigation into various categories.  Quantitative data are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can perform meaningful arithmetic calculations.    We might conduct a survey to determine the name of the favorite movie that each person in a math class saw in a movie theater.  When we conduct such a survey, the responses would look like: Finding Nemo, The Hulk, or Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. We might count the number of people who give each answer, but the answers themselves do not have any numerical values: we cannot perform computations with an answer like \"Finding Nemo.\" This would be categorical data.    A survey could ask the number of movies you have seen in a movie theater in the past 12 months (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)  This would be quantitative data.   Other examples of quantitative data would be the running time of the movie you saw most recently (104 minutes, 137 minutes, 104 minutes, ...) or the amount of money you paid for a movie ticket the last time you went to a movie theater ($5.50, $7.75, $9, ...).  Sometimes, determining whether or not data is categorical or quantitative can be a bit trickier.  Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location.  ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful mathematical calculations with them (it doesn't make sense to say that 98036 is \"twice\" 49018 — that's like saying that Lynnwood, WA is \"twice\" Battle Creek, MI, which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data.    A survey about the movie you most recently attended includes the question \"How would you rate the movie you just saw?\" with these possible answers:  1 - it was awful  2 - it was just OK  3 - I liked it  4 - it was great  5 - best movie ever!  Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but we can't really do any calculations with them: a movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; if two people see the movie and one of them thinks it stinks and the other thinks it's the best ever it doesn't necessarily make sense to say that \"on average they liked it.\"   As we study movie-going habits and preferences, we shouldn't forget to specify the population under consideration. If we survey 3-7 year-olds the runaway favorite might be Finding Nemo. 13-17 year-olds might prefer Terminator 3. And 33-37 year-olds might prefer...well, Finding Nemo.

  "title": "Sampling Methods and Sampling Bias",
  "body": " Sampling Methods and Sampling Bias    Compare sampling methods, such as simple random sampling, quota sampling, and convienence sampling  Discuss potiential sources of bias in sampling    As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a survey is to identify the population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a politician to determine the amount of support he has among the electorate should he decide to run for another term. What population should we study? Every person in the district? Not every person is eligible to vote, and regardless of how strongly someone likes or dislikes the candidate, they don't have much to do with him being re-elected if they are not able to vote.  What about eligible voters in the district? That might be better, but if someone is eligible to vote but does not register by the deadline, they won't have any say in the election either. What about registered voters? Many people are registered but choose not to vote. What about \"likely voters?\"  This is the criteria used in much political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a \"likely voter.\" Is it someone who voted in the last election? In the last general election? In the last presidential election? Should we consider someone who just turned 18 a \"likely voter?\" They weren't eligible to vote in the past, so how do we judge the likelihood that they will vote in the next election?  In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:    Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.  Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.  The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.    But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in the gubernatorial election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a turnout rate for elections) and so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias: they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.  Sampling Bias  A sampling method is biased if every member of the population doesn’t have equal likelihood of being in the sample.   So even identifying the population can be a difficult job, but once we have identified the population, how do we choose an appropriate sample? Remember, although we would prefer to survey all members of the population, this is usually impractical unless the population is very small, so we choose a sample. There are many ways to sample a population, but there is one goal we need to keep in mind: we would like the sample to be representative of the population.  Returning to our hypothetical job as a political pollster, we would not anticipate very accurate results if we drew all of our samples from among the customers at a Starbucks, nor would we expect that a sample drawn entirely from the membership list of the local Elks club would provide a useful picture of district-wide support for our candidate.  One way to ensure that the sample has a reasonable chance of mirroring the population is to employ randomness. The most basic random method is simple random sampling.  Simple Random Sample  A random sample is one in which each member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen. A simple random sample is one in which every member of the population and any group of members has an equal probability of being chosen.    If we could somehow identify all likely voters in the state, put each of their names on a piece of paper, toss the slips into a (very large) hat and draw 1000 slips out of the hat, we would have a simple random sample.   In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor than millions of slips of paper and extremely large headgear.  It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally representative of the population. If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among the population of likely voters in the state of Washington, some of these samples might tend to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or Republicans) than does the general population; some samples might include more older people and some samples might include more younger people; etc. In most cases, this sampling variability is not significant.  Sampling Variability  The natural variation of samples is called sampling variability.   This is unavoidable and expected in random sampling, and in most cases is not an issue.  To help account for variability, pollsters might instead use a stratified sample.  Stratified Sampling  In stratified sampling, a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are then taken from each subgroup with sample sizes proportional to the size of the subgroup in the population.    Suppose in a particular state that previous data indicated that the electorate was comprised of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they would then expect to get about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 independents. To accomplish this, they could randomly select 390 people from among those voters known to be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 from those with no party affiliation.   Stratified sampling can also be used to select a sample with people in desired age groups, a specified mix ratio of males and females, etc. A variation on this technique is called quota sampling.  Quota Sampling  Quota sampling is a variation on stratified sampling, wherein samples are collected in each subgroup until the desired quota is met.    Suppose the pollsters call people at random, but once they have met their quota of 390 Democrats, they only gather people who do not identify themselves as a Democrat.   You may have had the experience of being called by a telephone pollster who started by asking you your age, income, etc. and then thanked you for your time and hung up before asking any \"real\" questions. Most likely, they already had contacted enough people in your demographic group and were looking for people who were older or younger, richer or poorer, etc. Quota sampling is usually a bit easier than stratified sampling, but also does not ensure the same level of randomness.  Another sampling method is cluster sampling, in which the population is divided into groups, and one or more groups are randomly selected to be in the sample.  Cluster Sampling  In cluster sampling, the population is divided into subgroups (clusters), and a set of subgroups are selected to be in the sample.    If the college wanted to survey students, since students are already divided into classes, they could randomly select 10 classes and give the survey to all the students in those classes. This would be cluster sampling.   Systematic Sampling  In systematic sampling, every nth member of the population is selected to be in the sample.    To select a sample using systematic sampling, a pollster calls every 100th name in the phone book.  Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your name is Albert Aardvark and your sister Alexis Aardvark is right after you in the phone book, there is no way you could both end up in the sample) but it can yield acceptable samples.   Perhaps the worst types of sampling methods are convenience samples and voluntary response samples.  Convenience Sampling and Voluntary Response Sampling  Convenience sampling is samples chosen by selecting whoever is convenient.  Voluntary response sampling is allowing the sample to volunteer.    A pollster stands on a street corner and interviews the first 100 people who agree to speak to him. This is a convenience sample.    A website has a survey asking readers to give their opinion on a tax proposal. This is a self-selected sample, or voluntary response sample, in which respondents volunteer to participate.   Usually voluntary response samples are skewed towards people who have a particularly strong opinion about the subject of the survey or who just have way too much time on their hands and enjoy taking surveys.  Try It Now  In each case, indicate what sampling method was used:  Every 4th person in the class was selected  A sample was selected to contain 25 men and 35 women  Viewers of a new show are asked to vote on the show’s website  A website randomly selects 50 of their customers to send a satisfaction survey to  To survey voters in a town, a polling company randomly selects 10 city blocks, and interviews everyone who lives on those blocks.       Systematic  Stratified or Quota  Voluntary Response  Simple Random  Cluster      There are number of ways that a study can be ruined before you even start collecting data. The first we have already explored - sampling or selection bias, which is when the sample is not representative of the population. One example of this is voluntary response bias, which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who volunteer to participate. This is not the only potential source of bias.  Sources of bias  Some sources of bias in studies are:  Sampling bias - when the sample is not representative of the population  Voluntary response bias - the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is volunteers  Self-interest study - bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the outcome  Response bias - when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason  Perceived lack of anonymity - when the responder fears giving an honest answer might negatively affect them  Loaded questions - when the question wording influences the responses  Non-response bias - when people refusing to participate in the study can influence the validity of the outcome      Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers[1]. This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily ensure that the study was biased, it certainly suggests that we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    A survey asks people “when was the last time you visited your doctor?” This might suffer from response bias, since many people might not remember exactly when they last saw a doctor and give inaccurate responses.   Sources of response bias may be innocent, such as bad memory, or as intentional as pressuring by the pollster. Consider, for example, how many voting initiative petitions people sign without even reading them.   A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with members of other races. Here, a perceived lack of anonymity could influence the outcome. The respondent might not want to be perceived as racist even if they are, and give an untruthful answer.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have consequences; responses might not be accurate if the employees do not feel their responses are anonymous or fear retribution from their employer.    A survey asks “do you support funding research of alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high- polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question - questions whose wording leads the respondent towards an answer.   Loaded questions can occur intentionally by pollsters with an agenda, or accidentally through poor question wording. Also a concern is question order, where the order of questions changes the results. A psychology researcher provides an example:  My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied are you with your life? How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not statistically related - you would conclude that there is no relationship between dating frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How often do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship was a strong one. You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a student's life as dating frequency.   A telephone poll asks the question “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?”, and 50% of the people called refused to answer the survey. It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias, introduced by people refusing to participate in a study or dropping out of an experiment. When people refuse to participate, we can no longer be so certain that our sample is representative of the population.   Try It Now  In each situation, identify a potential source of bias:  A survey asks how many sexual partners a person has had in the last year  A radio station asks readers to phone in their choice in a daily poll.  A substitute teacher wants to know how students in the class did on their last test. The teacher asks the 10 students sitting in the front row to state their latest test score.  High school students are asked if they have consumed alcohol in the last two weeks.  The Beef Council releases a study stating that consuming red meat poses little cardiovascular risk.  A poll asks “Do you support a new transportation tax, or would you prefer to see our public transportation system fall apart?”       Response bias - historically, men are likely to over-report, and women are likely to under-report to this question.  Voluntary response bias - the sample is self-selected  Sampling bias - the sample may not be representative of the whole class  Lack of anonymity  Self-interest study  Loaded question      "

  "title": "Experiments",
  "body": " Experiments    Discuss case studies and experiments    So far, we have primarily discussed observational studies - studies in which conclusions would be drawn from observations of a sample or the population. In some cases these observations might be unsolicited, such as studying the percentage of cars that turn right at a red light even when there is a “no turn on red” sign. In other cases the observations are solicited, like in a survey or a poll.  In contrast, it is common to use experiments when exploring how subjects react to an outside influence. In an experiment, some kind of treatment is applied to the subjects and the results are measured and recorded.  Observational Studies and Experiments  An observational study is a study based on observations or measurements. An experiment is a study in which the effects of a treatment are measured.   Here are some examples of experiments:  A pharmaceutical company tests a new medicine for treating Alzheimer’s disease by administering the drug to 50 elderly patients with recent diagnoses. The treatment here is the new drug.  A gym tests out a new weight loss program by enlisting 30 volunteers to try out the program. The treatment here is the new program.  You test a new kitchen cleaner by buying a bottle and cleaning your kitchen. The new cleaner is the treatment.  A psychology researcher explores the effect of music on temperament by measuring people’s temperament while listening to different types of music. The music is the treatment.    Try It Now  Is each scenario describing an observational study or an experiment?  The weights of 30 randomly selected people are measured  Subjects are asked to do 20 jumping jacks, and then their heart rates are measured  Twenty coffee drinkers and twenty tea drinkers are given a concentration test       Observational study  Experiment; the treatment is the jumping jacks  Experiment; the treatments are coffee and tea      When conducting experiments, it is essential to isolate the treatment being tested.   Suppose a middle school (junior high) finds that their students are not scoring well on the state’s standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if an alternate curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.   The difficulty with this scenario is that it is not clear whether the curriculum is responsible for the improvement, or whether the improvement is due to a math specialist teaching the class. This is called confounding - when it is not clear which factor or factors caused the observed effect. Confounding is the downfall of many experiments, though sometimes it is hidden.  Confounding  Confounding occurs when there are two potential variables that could have caused the outcome and it is not possible to determine which actually caused the result.    A drug company study about a weight loss pill might report that people lost an average of 8 pounds while using their new drug. However, in the fine print you find a statement saying that participants were encouraged to also diet and exercise. It is not clear in this case whether the weight loss is due to the pill, to diet and exercise, or a combination of both. In this case confounding has occurred.    Researchers conduct an experiment to determine whether students will perform better on an arithmetic test if they listen to music during the test. They first give the student a test without music, then give a similar test while the student listens to music. In this case, the student might perform better on the second test, regardless of the music, simply because it was the second test and they were warmed up.   There are a number of measures that can be introduced to help reduce the likelihood of confounding. The primary measure is to use a control group.  Control Group  When using a control group, the participants are divided into two or more groups, typically a control group and a treatment group. The treatment group receives the treatment being tested; the control group does not receive the treatment.   Ideally, the groups are otherwise as similar as possible, isolating the treatment as the only potential source of difference between the groups. For this reason, the method of dividing groups is important. Some researchers attempt to ensure that the groups have similar characteristics (same number of females, same number of people over 50, etc.), but it is nearly impossible to control for every characteristic. Because of this, random assignment is very commonly used.   To determine if a two day prep course would help high school students improve their scores on the SAT test, a group of students was randomly divided into two subgroups. The first group, the treatment group, was given a two day prep course. The second group, the control group, was not given the prep course. Afterwards, both groups were given the SAT.    A company testing a new plant food grows two crops of plants in adjacent fields, the treatment group receiving the new plant food and the control group not. The crop yield would then be compared. By growing them at the same time in adjacent fields, they are controlling for weather and other confounding factors.   Sometimes not giving the control group anything does not completely control for confounding variables. For example, suppose a medicine study is testing a new headache pill by giving the treatment group the pill and the control group nothing. If the treatment group showed improvement, we would not know whether it was due to the medicine in the pill, or a response to have taken any pill. This is called a placebo effect.  Placebo Effect  The placebo effect is when the effectiveness of a treatment is influenced by the patient’s perception of how effective they think the treatment will be, so a result might be seen even if the treatment is ineffectual.    A study found that when doing painful dental tooth extractions, patients told they were receiving a strong painkiller while actually receiving a saltwater injection found as much pain relief as patients receiving a dose of morphine.   To control for the placebo effect, a placebo, or dummy treatment, is often given to the control group. This way, both groups are truly identical except for the specific treatment given.  Placebo and Placebo controlled experiments  A placebo is a dummy treatment given to control for the placebo effect. An experiment that gives the control group a placebo is called a placebo controlled experiment.    In a study for a new medicine that is dispensed in a pill form, a sugar pill could be used as a placebo.  In a study on the effect of alcohol on memory, a non-alcoholic beer might be given to the control group as a placebo.  In a study of a frozen meal diet plan, the treatment group would receive the diet food, and the control could be given standard frozen meals stripped of their original packaging.   In some cases, it is more appropriate to compare to a conventional treatment than a placebo. For example, in a cancer research study, it would not be ethical to deny any treatment to the control group or to give a placebo treatment. In this case, the currently acceptable medicine would be given to the control group, sometimes called a comparison group in this case. In our SAT test example, the non-treatment group would most likely be encouraged to study on their own, rather than be asked to not study at all, to provide a meaningful comparison.  When using a placebo, it would defeat the purpose if the participant knew they were receiving the placebo.  Blind Studies  A blind study is one in which the participant does not know whether or not they are receiving the treatment or a placebo. A double-blind study is one in which those interacting with the participants don’t know who is in the treatment group and who is in the control group.    In a study about anti-depression medicine, you would not want the psychological evaluator to know whether the patient is in the treatment or control group either, as it might influence their evaluation, so the experiment should be conducted as a double-blind study.   It should be noted that not every experiment needs a control group.   If a researcher is testing whether a new fabric can withstand fire, she simply needs to torch multiple samples of the fabric - there is no need for a control group.   Try It Now  To test a new lie detector, two groups of subjects are given the new test. One group is asked to answer all the questions truthfully, and the second group is asked to lie on one set of questions. The person administering the lie detector test does not know what group each subject is in.  Does this experiment have a control group? Is it blind, double-blind, or neither?  The truth-telling group could be considered the control group, but really both groups are treatment groups here, since it is important for the lie detector to be able to correctly identify lies, and also not identify truth telling as lying. This study is blind, since the person running the test does not know what group each subject is in.   "

The day before the election, a telephone poll of 350 randomly selected registered voters was conducted. 112 said they'd vote for Brown, 207 said they'd vote for Feliz, and 31 were undecided.  What is the population of this survey?  What is the size of the population?  What is the size of the sample?  Give the sample statistic for the proportion of voters surveyed who said they'd vote for Brown.  Based on this sample, we might expect how many of the 9500 voters to vote for Brown?      As part of a math project, a student take a container filled with red and green candies that are well-mixed. The student pulls out 30 candies with the goal of estimating the number of red candies in the jar. Of the 30 candies, 12 of them are red.  Describe the target population.  Describe the sample.  What sampling method is used?  Give the sample statistic for the proportion of candies that are red.  If the jar contains 800 candies, esimate how many of them are red.     Identify the most relevant source of bias in this situation: A survey asks the following: Should the mall prohibit loud and annoying rock music in clothing stores catering to teenagers?

Identify the most relevant source of bias in this situation: A study seeks to investigate whether a new pain medication is safe to market to the public. They test by randomly selecting 300 men from a set of volunteers.  In a study, you ask the subjects their age in years. Is this data qualitative or quantitative?  In a study, you ask the subjects their gender. Is this data qualitative or quantitative?  Does this describe an observational study or an experiment: The temperature on randomly selected days throughout the year was measured.  Does this describe an observational study or an experiment? A group of students are told to listen to music while taking a test and their results are compared to a group not listening to music.  In a study, the sample is chosen by separating all cars by size, and selecting 10 of each size grouping. What is the sampling method?  In a study, the sample is chosen by writing everyone’s name on a playing card, shuffling the deck, then choosing the top 20 cards. What is the sampling method?   A researcher wants to study the effectiveness of a \"test-taking-energy-drink\". They select 1,000 volunteers from colleges around the country and divide them into two groups. Those enrolled in English classes were given the real drink, and those enrolled in math classes were given a fake drink. None of the students knew which drink they were getting, but the researchers knew. The researchers compared test scores of both groups of students and concluded that the student who received the test-taking drink performed significantly betters on tests.  Describe the target population.  Describe the control group and the treatment group in this experiment.  Is this experiment blind? Double-blind?  Why might the results of this experiment be unreliable?      A team of researchers is testing the effectiveness of a new HPV vaccine. They randomly divide the subjects into two groups. Group 1 receives new HPV vaccine, and Group 2 receives the existing HPV vaccine. The patients in the study do not know which group they are in.  Which is the treatment group?  Which is the control group (if there is one)?  Is this study blind, double-blind, or neither?  Is this best described as an experiment, a controlled experiment, or a placebo controlled experiment?       Group 1, receiving the vaccine  Group 2 is acting as a control group. They are not receiving the treatment (new vaccine).  The study is at least blind. We are not provided enough information to determine if it is double-blind.  This is a controlled experiment.      For the clinical trials of a weight loss drug containing Garcinia cambogia the subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The first received an inert pill along with an exercise and diet plan, while the second received the test medicine along with the same exercise and diet plan. The patients do not know which group they are in, nor do the fitness and nutrition advisors.  Which is the treatment group?  Which is the control group (if there is one)?  Is this study blind, double-blind, or neither?  Is this best described as an experiment, a controlled experiment, or a placebo controlled experiment?      A teacher wishes to know whether the males in his\/her class have more conservative attitudes than the females. A questionnaire is distributed assessing attitudes.  Is this a sampling or a census?  Is this an observational study or an experiment?  Are there any possible sources of bias in this study?       Census  Observational study      A study is conducted to determine whether people learn better with spaced or massed practice. Subjects volunteer from an introductory psychology class. At the beginning of the semester 12 subjects volunteer and are assigned to the massed-practice group. At the end of the semester 12 subjects volunteer and are assigned to the spaced-practice condition.  Is this a sampling or a census?  Is this an observational study or an experiment?  This study involves two kinds of non-random sampling: (1) Subjects are not randomly sampled from some specified population and (2) Subjects are not randomly assigned to groups. Which problem is more serious? What affect on the results does each have?     A farmer believes that playing Barry Manilow songs to his peas will increase their yield. Describe a controlled experiment the farmer could use to test his theory.  A sports psychologist believes that people are more likely to be extroverted as adults if they played team sports as children. Describe two possible studies to test this theory. Design one as an observational study and the other as an experiment. Which is more practical?   Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment program. Suppose that a new AIDS antibody drug is currently under study. It is given to patients once the AIDS symptoms have revealed themselves. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 50 AIDS patients from the start of treatment until their deaths.  What is the population of this study?  List two reasons why the data may differ.  Can you tell if one researcher is correct and the other one is incorrect? Why?  Would you expect the data to be identical? Why or why not?  If the first researcher collected her data by randomly selecting 40 states, then selecting 1 person from each of those states. What sampling method is that?  If the second researcher collected his data by choosing 40 patients he knew. What sampling method would that researcher have used? What concerns would you have about this data set, based upon the data collection method?     Find a newspaper or magazine article, or the online equivalent, describing the results of a recent study (the results of a poll are not sufficient). Give a summary of the study’s findings, then analyze whether the article provided enough information to determine the validity of the conclusions. If not, produce a list of things that are missing from the article that would help you determine the validity of the study. Look for the things discussed in the text: population, sample, randomness, blind, control, placebos, etc.  "

How could we create observational study to test whether those who drink coffee go to bed later than those who don’t?  We could select a group of people and assign half of them to drink coffee and the other half to not drink any coffee. We would ask the participants to record their bedtimes and compare the results.

  "body": " Presenting Data Graphically    Create and frequency tables for data sets  Create and read bar graphs and histograms  Interpret pie charts    Categorical, or qualitative, data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the objects under investigation into various categories. We usually begin working with categorical data by summarizing the data into a frequency table.  Frequency Table  A frequency table is a table with two columns. One column lists the categories, and another for the frequencies with which the items in the categories occur (how many items fit into each category).    An insurance company determines vehicle insurance premiums based on known risk factors. If a person is considered a higher risk, their premiums will be higher. One potential factor is the color of your car. The insurance company believes that people with some color cars are more likely to get in accidents. To research this, they examine police reports for recent total-loss collisions. The data is summarized in the frequency table below.     Color  Frequency    Blue  25    Green  52    Red  41    White  36    Black  39    Grey  23      Sometimes we need an even more intuitive way of displaying data. This is where charts and graphs come in. There are many, many ways of displaying data graphically, but we will concentrate on one very useful type of graph called a bar graph. In this section we will work with bar graphs that display categorical data; the next section will be devoted to bar graphs that display quantitative data.  Bar graph A bar graph is a graph that displays a bar for each category with the length of each bar indicating the frequency of that category.  To construct a bar graph, we need to draw a vertical axis and a horizontal axis. The vertical direction will have a scale and measure the frequency of each category; the horizontal axis has no scale in this instance. The construction of a bar chart is most easily described by use of an example.   Using our car data from above, note the highest frequency is 52, so our vertical axis needs to go from 0 to 52, but we might as well use 0 to 55, so that we can put a hash mark every 5 units:   Image Credit: RRCC   A bar graph with colors of cars on the horizontal axis and frequencies on the vertical axis.     Notice that the height of each bar is determined by the frequency of the corresponding color. The horizontal gridlines are a nice touch, but not necessary. In practice, you will find it useful to draw bar graphs using graph paper, so the gridlines will already be in place, or using technology. Instead of gridlines, we might also list the frequencies at the top of each bar, like this:   Image Credit: RRCC   A bar graph with colors of cars on the horizontal axis, frequencies on the vertical axis, and the freuencies labeled on top of each bar.      In this case, our chart might benefit from being reordered from largest to smallest frequency values. This arrangement can make it easier to compare similar values in the chart, even without gridlines. When we arrange the categories in decreasing frequency order like this, it is called a Pareto chart.  Pareto chart A Pareto chart is a bar graph ordered from highest to lowest frequency.   Transforming our bar graph from earlier into a Pareto chart, we get:   Image Credit: RRCC   The bar graph is organized so the color (Green) with the largest frequncy (52) is listed first. The frequencies decrease from left to right.       In a survey, adults were asked whether they personally worried about a variety of environmental concerns. The numbers (out of 1012 surveyed) who indicated that they worried “a great deal” about some selected concerns are summarized below. Create a bar graph to illustrate this data.     Environmental Issue  Frequency    Pollution of drinking water  597    Contamination of soil by toxic waste  526    Air pollution  455    Global warming  354      This data could be shown graphically in a bar graph:   Image Credit: RRCC   A bar graph with water pollution, toxic waster, air pollution, and global warming on the horiztonal axis and frequencies of each on the vertical axis.       To show relative sizes, it is common to use a pie chart.  Pie Chart  A pie chart is a circle with wedges cut of varying sizes marked out like slices of pie or pizza. The relative sizes of the wedges correspond to the relative frequencies of the categories.   For our vehicle color data, a pie chart might look like this:   A pie chart with six wedges--one corresponding to each color of car from the previous examples. The size of the wedge corresponds to the relative size of the frequency.   Pie charts can often benefit from including frequencies or relative frequencies (percents) in the chart next to the pie slices. Often having the category names next to the pie slices also makes the chart clearer.   The same pie chart as in the previous example, but with freqencies and colors listed next to each wedge.     The pie chart to the right shows the percentage of voters supporting each candidate running for a local senate seat.  If there are 20,000 voters in the district, the pie chart shows that about 11% of those, about 2,200 voters, support Reeves.   A pie chart with three wedges labeled: Ellison (46%), Douglas (43%) and Reeves (11%)    Pie charts look nice, but are harder to draw by hand than bar charts since to draw them accurately we would need to compute the angle each wedge cuts out of the circle, then measure the angle with a protractor. Computers are much better suited to drawing pie charts. Common software programs like Microsoft Word or Excel, OpenOffice.org Write or Calc, or Google Docs are able to create bar graphs, pie charts, and other graph types. There are also numerous online tools that can create graphs.  Try It Now  Create a bar graph and a pie chart to illustrate the grades on a history exam below.  A: 12 students, B: 19 students, C: 14 students, D: 4 students, F: 5 students    A bar graph with A, B, C, D, and F on the horizontal axis and frequencies of each on the vertical axis. A pie chart with five wedges: A (22%), B (36%), C (26%), D (7%) and F (9%)     Don’t get fancy with graphs! People sometimes add features to graphs that don’t help to convey their information. For example, 3-dimensional bar charts like the one shown below are usually not as effective as their two- dimensional counterparts.   A 3-dimensional bar graph corresponding the same data as the car colors and collisons from earlier.   Here is another way that fanciness can lead to trouble. Instead of plain bars, it is tempting to substitute meaningful images. This type of graph is called a pictogram.  A pictogram is a statistical graphic in which the size of the picture is intended to represent the frequencies or size of the values being represented.   A labor union might produce the graph to show the difference between the average manager salary and the average worker salary.   A large bag of money labeled manager salaries next to a bag of labeled that is half as tall labeled worker salaries.   Looking at the picture, it would be reasonable to guess that the manager salaries is 4 times as large as the worker salaries - the area of the bag looks about 4 times as large. However, the manager salaries are in fact only twice as large as worker salaries, which were reflected in the picture by making the manager bag twice as tall.   Another distortion in bar charts results from setting the baseline to a value other than zero. The baseline is the bottom of the vertical axis, representing the least number of cases that could have occurred in a category. Normally, this number should be zero.   Compare the two graphs below showing support for same-sex marriage rights from a poll taken in December 2008. The difference in the vertical scale on the first graph suggests a different story than the true differences in percentages; the second graph makes it look like twice as many people oppose marriage rights as support it.   The first graph has a bar labeled support that starts at 0 and ends at 45 and a bar labeled oppose that starts at 0 and ends at 55. The second graph has a bar from support that starts at 40 and ends at 45, and an oppose bar that starts at 40 and ends at 55.    Try It Now  A poll was taken asking people if they agreed with the positions of the 4 candidates for a county office. Does the pie chart present a good representation of this data? Explain.   A pie chart with four wedges: Nguyen (42%), McKee (35%), Jones (64%) and Brown (52%).   While the pie chart accurately depicts the relative size of the people agreeing with each candidate, the chart is confusing, since usually percents on a pie chart represent the percentage of the pie the slice represents.   Quantitative, or numerical, data can also be summarized into frequency tables.   A teacher records scores on a 20-point quiz for the 30 students in his class. The scores are:  19 20 18 18 17 18 19 17 20 18 20 16 20 15 17  12 18 19 18 19 17 20 18 16 15 18 20 5 0 0  These scores could be summarized into a frequency table by grouping like values:     Score  Frequency    0  2    5  1    12  1    15  2    16  2    17  4    18  8    19  4    20  6     Using this table, it would be possible to create a standard bar chart from this summary, like we did for categorical data:   Image Credit: RRCC   A bar graph with scores on the horizontal axis and corresponding frequencies on the vertical axis.     However, since the scores are numerical values, this chart doesn’t really make sense; the first and second bars are five values apart, while the later bars are only one value apart. It would be more correct to treat the horizontal axis as a number line. This type of graph is called a histogram.   Histogram  A histogram is like a bar graph, but where the horizontal axis is a number line    For the values above, a histogram would look like:   Image Credit: RRCC   The horizontal axis is a number line with evenly spaced tick marks. Bars for test scores that are next to each other are touching.      Notice that in the histogram, a bar represents values on the horizontal axis from that on the left hand-side of the bar up to, but not including, the value on the right hand side of the bar. Some people choose to have bars start at values to avoid this ambiguity.   Image Credit: RRCC   The same histogram as in the previous image, but with tick marks placed in the middle of each bar, rather than to the sides.     Unfortunately, not a lot of common software packages can correctly graph a histogram. About the best you can do in Excel or Word is a bar graph with no gap between the bars and spacing added to simulate a numerical horizontal axis.  If we have a large number of widely varying data values, creating a frequency table that lists every possible value as a category would lead to an exceptionally long frequency table, and probably would not reveal any patterns. For this reason, it is common with quantitative data to group data into class intervals.  Class Intervals  Class intervals are groupings of the data. In general, we define class intervals so that:    Each interval is equal in size. For example, if the first class contains values from 120-129, the second class should include values from 130-139.  We have somewhere between 5 and 20 classes, typically, depending upon the number of data we’re working with.      Suppose that we have collected weights from 100 male subjects as part of a nutrition study. For our weight data, we have values ranging from a low of 121 pounds to a high of 263 pounds, giving a total span of 263-121 = 142. We could create 7 intervals with a width of around 20, 14 intervals with a width of around 10, or somewhere in between. Often time we have to experiment with a few possibilities to find something that represents the data well. Let us try using an interval width of 15. We could start at 121, or at 120 since it is a nice round number.     Interval  Frequency    120 - 134  4    135 - 149  14    150 - 164  16    165 - 179  28    180 - 194  12    195 - 209  8    210 - 224  7    225 - 239  6    240 - 254  2    255 - 269  3     A histogram of this data would look like:   Image Credit: RRCC   A histogram with weights on the horizontal axis and frequencies on the vertical axis.     Other graph types such as pie charts are possible for quantitative data. The usefulness of different graph types will vary depending upon the number of intervals and the type of data being represented. For example, a pie chart of our weight data is difficult to read because of the quantity of intervals we used.   A pie chart with 10 wedges--one corresponding to each class interval.    Try It Now  The total cost of textbooks for the term was collected from 36 students. Create a histogram for this data.  $140 $160 $160 $165 $180 $220 $235 $240 $250 $260 $280 $285  $285 $285 $290 $300 $300 $305 $310 $310 $315 $315 $320 $320  $330 $340 $345 $350 $355 $360 $360 $380 $395 $420 $460 $460   Using a class intervals of size 55, we can group our data into six intervals:     Cost Interval  Frequency    $140 - 194  5    $195 - 249  3    $250 - 304  9    $305 - 359  12    $360 - 414  4    $415 - 469  3     We can use the frequency distribution to generate the histogram.   Image Credit: RRCC   A histogram with the class intervals from the table above on the horizontal axis and frequencies on the vertical axis.       When collecting data to compare two groups, it is desirable to create a graph that compares quantities.   The data below came from a task in which the goal is to move a computer mouse to a target on the screen as fast as possible. On 20 of the trials, the target was a small rectangle; on the other 20, the target was a large rectangle. Time to reach the target was recorded on each trial.     Interval (milliseconds)  Frequency, Small Target  Frequency, Large Target    300 - 399  0  0    400 - 499  1  5    500 - 599  3  10    600 - 699  6  5    700 - 799  5  0    800 - 899  4  0    900 - 999  0  0    1000 - 1099  1  0    1100 - 1199  0  0     One option to represent this data would be a comparative histogram or bar chart, in which bars for the small target group and large target group are placed next to each other.   Image Credit: RRCC   A histogram with bars for the small target in blue, next to bars for the target in red.      Frequency Polygon  An alternative representation is a frequency polygon. A frequency polygon starts out like a histogram, but instead of drawing a bar, a point is placed in the midpoint of each interval at height equal to the frequency. Typically the points are connected with straight lines to emphasize the distribution of the data.    This graph makes it easier to see that reaction times were generally shorter for the larger target, and that the reaction times for the smaller target were more spread out.   Image Credit: RRCC   Points are plotted in blue corresponding to the frequencies of the small target and then connected with line segments. The same is done on the same axes in red with the data for the large target.      "

  "body": "Measures of Central Tendency    Compute the mean, median, and mode of data sets    It is often desirable to use a few numbers to summarize a distribution. One important aspect of a distribution is where its center is located. Measures of central tendency are discussed first. A second aspect of a distribution is how spread out it is. In other words, how much the data in the distribution vary from one another. The next section describes measures of variability.  Let's begin by trying to find the most \"typical\" value of a data set.  Note that we just used the word \"typical\" although in many cases you might think of using the word \"average.\" We need to be careful with the word \"average\" as it means different things to different people in different contexts. One of the most common uses of the word \"average\" is what mathematicians and statisticians call the arithmetic mean, or just plain old mean for short. \"Arithmetic mean\" sounds rather fancy, but you have likely calculated a mean many times without realizing it; the mean is what most people think of when they use the word \"average\".  Mean  The mean of a set of data is the sum of the data values divided by the number of values.    Marci’s exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, 94. What is the mean of those values?    Typically we round means to one more decimal place than the original data had. In this case, we would round 85.25 to 85.3.     The number of touchdown (TD) passes thrown by each of the 31 teams in the National Football League in the 2000 season are shown below.  37 33 33 32 29 28 28 23 22 22 22 21 21 21 20  20 19 19 18 18 18 18 16 15 14 14 14 12 12 9 6   Adding these values, we get 634 total TDs. Dividing by 31, the number of data values, we get . It would be appropriate to round this to 20.5.  It would be most correct for us to report that “The mean number of touchdown passes thrown in the NFL in the 2000 season was 20.5 passes,” but it is not uncommon to see the more casual word “average” used in place of \"mean\"    Try It Now  The price of a jar of peanut butter at 5 stores was: $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99. Find the mean price.  Adding the prices and dividing by 5 we get the mean price: $3.682    The one hundred families in a particular neighborhood are asked their annual household income, to the nearest $5 thousand dollars. The results are summarized in a frequency table below. Find the mean annual household income.     Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency    15  6    20  8    25  11    30  17    35  19    40  20    45  12    50  7      Calculating the mean by hand could get tricky if we try to type in all 100 values:   We could calculate this more easily by noticing that adding 15 to itself six times is the same as . Using this simplification, we get   The mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars ($33,900).     Extending off the last example, suppose a new family moves into the neighborhood example that has a household income of $5 million ($5000 thousand). What is the mean household income?    While 83.1 thousand dollars ($83,069) is the correct mean household income, it no longer represents a “typical” value.    Imagine the data values on a see-saw or balance scale. The mean is the value that keeps the data in balance, like in the picture below.   A scale with one large block to left of the fulcrum and two smaller blocks to the right of the fulcrum.  If we graph our household data, the $5 million data value is so far out to the right that the mean has to adjust up to keep things in balance.   A fourth block has been added to the scale, much further to the right than the others. The moves the center of balance so the orginal three blocks are to the left of the fulcrum and the new block is to the right of the fulcrum.  For this reason, when working with data that have outliers - values far outside the primary grouping - it is common to use a different measure of center, the median.  Median  The median is the value separating the higher half of a dataset from the lower lower half of the dataset.  To find the median, begin by listing the data in order from smallest to largest, or largest to smallest.  If the number of data values, , is odd, then the median is the middle data value. This value can be found by rounding up to the next whole number.  If the number of data values is even, there is no one middle value, so we find the mean of the two middle values (values and ).    Returning to the football touchdown data, we would start by listing the data in order. Luckily, it was already in decreasing order, so we can work with it without needing to reorder it first.  37 33 33 32 29 28 28 23 22 22 22 21 21 21 20  20 19 19 18 18 18 18 16 15 14 14 14 12 12 9 6   Since there are 31 data values, an odd number, the median will be the middle number, the 16th data value ( ), round up to 16, leaving 15 values below and 15 above). The 16th data value is 20, so the median number of touchdown passes in the 2000 season was 20 passes. Notice that for this data, the median is fairly close to the mean we calculated earlier, 20.5.     Find the median of these quiz scores: 5 10 8 6 4 8 2 5 7 7   We start by listing the data in order: 2 4 5 5 6 7 7 8 8 10  Since there are 10 data values, an even number, there is no one middle number. So we find the mean of the two middle numbers, 6 and 7, and get  The median quiz score was 6.5.    Try It Now  The price of a jar of peanut butter at 5 stores were: $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99. Find the median price.  First we put the data in order: $3.29, $3.59, $3.75, $3.79, $3.99. Since there are an odd number of data, the median will be the middle value, $3.75.    Let us return now to our original household income data     Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency    15  6    20  8    25  11    30  17    35  19    40  20    45  12    50  7     What is the median household income?   Here we have 100 data values. If we didn’t already know that, we could find it by adding the frequencies. Since 100 is an even number, we need to find the mean of the middle two data values - the 50th and 51st data values.  To find these, we can assign a number to each of the data values based on its position. The first 6 values are $15, so values 1 - 6 are $15 thousand. The next 8 data values are $20 thousand. , so values 7 - 14 are $20 thousand. The rest is summarized in the table:     Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency  Values    15  6  1 - 6    20  8  7 - (6 + 8) = 7 - 14    25  11  15 - (14 + 11) = 15 - 25    30  17  26 - (25 + 17) = 26 - 42    35  19  43 - (42 + 19) = 43 - 61    40  20  62 - (61 + 20) = 62 - 81    45  12  82 - (81 + 12) = 82 - 93    50  7  94 - (93 + 7) = 94 - 100     From this we can tell that values 50 and 51 will be $35 thousand, and the mean of these two values is $35 thousand. The median income in this neighborhood is $35 thousand.    If we add in the new neighbor with a $5 million household income, then there will be 101 data values, and the 51st value will be the median. As we discovered in the last example, the 51st value is $35 thousand. Notice that the new neighbor did not affect the median in this case. The median is not swayed as much by outliers as the mean is.   In addition to the mean and the median, there is one other common measurement of the \"typical\" value of a data set: the mode.  Mode  The mode is the element of the data set that occurs most frequently.   The mode is fairly useless with data like weights or heights where there are a large number of possible values. The mode is most commonly used for categorical data, for which median and mean cannot be computed.   In our vehicle color survey, we collected the data     Color  Frequency    Blue  3    Green  5    Red  4    White  3    Black  2    Grey  3     For this data, Green is the mode, since it is the data value that occurred the most frequently.   It is possible for a data set to have more than one mode if several categories have the same frequency, or no modes if each every category occurs only once.  Try It Now  Reviewers were asked to rate a product on a scale of 1 to 5.

Ratings of 1 are the first 4 values, while a rating of 2 are the next 8 values, so the 12th value will be a rating of 2. The median is 2.  The mode is the most frequent rating.

The rest is summarized in the table:     Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency  Values    15  6  1 - 6    20  8  7 - (6 + 8) = 7 - 14    25  11  15 - (14 + 11) = 15 - 25    30  17  26 - (25 + 17) = 26 - 42    35  19  43 - (42 + 19) = 43 - 61    40  20  62 - (61 + 20) = 62 - 81    45  12  82 - (81 + 12) = 82 - 93    50  7  94 - (93 + 7) = 94 - 100     From this we can tell that values 50 and 51 will be $35 thousand, and the mean of these two values is $35 thousand. The median income in this neighborhood is $35 thousand.   "

  "body": "   Compute the range of a data set  Compute sample and population standard deviations  Use the coefficient of variation to compare standard deviations  Create a five-number summary of a data set  Create a box plot for a data set    Measures of Variation  Consider these three sets of quiz scores:  Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5  Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10  Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6  All three of these sets of data have a mean of 5 and median of 5, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different. In section A, everyone had the same score; in section B half the class got no points and the other half got a perfect score, assuming this was a 10-point quiz. Section C was not as consistent as section A, but not as widely varied as section B.  In addition to the mean and median, which are measures of the \"typical\" or \"middle\" value, we also need a measure of how \"spread out\" or varied each data set is.  There are several ways to measure this \"spread\" of the data. The first is the simplest and is called the range.  Range  The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the data set.    Using the quiz scores from above,  For section A, the range is 0 since both maximum and minimum are 5 and  For section B, the range is 10 since  For section C, the range is 2 since   In the last example, the range seems to be revealing how spread out the data is. However, suppose we add a fourth section, Section D, with scores 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10.  This section also has a mean and median of 5. The range is 10, yet this data set is quite different than Section B. To better illuminate the differences, we’ll have to turn to more sophisticated measures of variation.  Standard Deviation  The standard deviation is a measure of variation based on measuring how far each data value deviates, or is \\ different, from the mean. A few important characteristics:    Standard deviation is always positive. Standard deviation will be zero if all the data values are equal, and will get larger as the data spreads out.  Standard deviation has the same units as the original data.  Standard deviation, like the mean, can be highly influenced by outliers.     Using the data from section D, we could compute for each data value the difference between the data value and the mean:     data value  deviation: data value - mean    0     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     10      We would like to get an idea of the \"average\" deviation from the mean, but if we find the average of the values in the second column the negative and positive values cancel each other out (this will always happen), so to prevent this we square every value in the second column:  We then add the squared deviations up to get . Ordinarily we would then divide by the number of scores, , (in this case, 10) to find the mean of the deviations. But we only do this if the data set represents a population; if the data set represents a sample (as it almost always does), we instead divide by (in this case, ).  So in our example, we would have if section D represents a population and if section D represents a sample. These values (5 and 5.56) are called, respectively, the population variance and the sample variance for section D.  Variance can be a useful statistical concept, but note that the units of variance in this instance would be points- squared since we squared all of the deviations. What are points-squared? Good question. We would rather deal with the units we started with (points in this case), so to convert back we take the square root and get:  population standard deviation =  sample standard deviation =  If we are unsure whether the data set is a sample or a population, we will usually assume it is a sample, and we will round answers to one more decimal place than the original data, as we have done above.  Computing Standard Deviation  To compute standard deviation:    Find the deviation of each data from the mean. In other words, subtract the mean from the data value.  Square each deviation.  Add the squared deviations.  Divide by , the number of data values, if the data represents a whole population; divide by , if the data is from a sample.  Compute the square root of the result.      Computing the standard deviation for Section B above, we first calculate that the mean is 5. Using a table can help keep track of your computations for the standard deviation:     data value  deviation  deviation squared    0      0      0      0      0      10      10      10      10      10       Assuming this data represents a population, we will add the squared deviations, divide by 10, the number of data values, and compute the square root:   Notice that the standard deviation of this data set is much larger than that of section D since the data in this set is more spread out.   For comparison, the standard deviations of all four sections are:  Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5; Standard Deviation = 0  Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10; Standard Deviation = 5  Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6; Standard Devation = 0.8  Section D: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10; Standard Deviation = 2.2  Try It Now  The price of a jar of peanut butter at 5 stores were: $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99. Find the standard deviation of the prices.  $0.261   If we want to compare standard deviations of different datasets, with different means, we have to compute the coefficient of varation . The coefficient of variation gives information about how large the standard deviation is relative to the mean.  Coefficient of Variation  For a dataset with a mean value of and and standard deviation of , the coefficient of variation is:     You are comparing stock prices for two different stocks over the past year.  Stock A has mean price of $3.50 per share with a standard deviation of $0.30.  Stock B has mean price of $8 per share with a standard deviation of $0.50.    Compute the coefficient of variation for each stock.  Which stock had more consistent prices over the past year?         Stock A has a CV of 8.6% and Stock B has a CV of 6.25%  Since Stock A has a larger CV, it had prices that were more spread out. Therefore, Stock B had more consistent prices over the past year.      Where standard deviation is a measure of variation based on the mean, quartiles are based on the median.  Quartiles  Quartiles are values that divide the data in quarters.  The first quartile ( ) is the value so that 25% of the data values are below it; the third quartile ( ) is the value so that 75% of the data values are below it. You may have guessed that the second quartile is the same as the median, since the median is the value so that 50% of the data values are below it.  This divides the data into quarters; 25% of the data is between the minimum and , 25% is between and the median, 25% is between the median and , and 25% is between and the maximum value.   While quartiles are not a 1-number summary of variation like standard deviation, the quartiles are used with the median, minimum, and maximum values to form a 5 number summary of the data.  Five number summary The five number summary takes this form:  Minimum, , Median, , Maximum   To find the first quartile, we need to find the data value so that 25% of the data is below it. If is the number of data values, we compute a locator by finding 25% of . If this locator is a decimal value, we round up, and find the data value in that position. If the locator is a whole number, we find the mean of the data value in that position and the next data value. This is identical to the process we used to find the median, except we use 25% of the data values rather than half the data values as the locator.  Finding  To find the first quartile, :  Begin by ordering the data from smallest to largest  Compute the locator:  If L is a decimal value: Round up to  Use the data value in the position  If L is a whole number: Find the mean of the data values in the and positions.   Finding  To find the third quartile, :  Use the same procedure as for , but with locator:   Examples should help make this clearer.   Suppose we have measured 9 females and their heights (in inches), sorted from smallest to largest are:  59 60 62 64 66 67 69 70 72  To find the first quartile we first compute the locator: 25% of 9 is . Since this value is not a whole number, we round up to 3.  The first quartile will be the third data value: 62 inches.  To find the third quartile, we again compute the locator: 75% of 9 is . Since this value is not a whole number, we round up to 7.  The third quartile will be the seventh data value: 69 inches.    Suppose we had measured 8 females and their heights (in inches), sorted from smallest to largest are:  59 60 62 64 66 67 69 70  To find the first quartile we first compute the locator: 25% of 8 is .  Since this value is a whole number, we will find the mean of the 2nd and 3rd data values: , so the first quartile is 61 inches.  The third quartile is computed similarly, using 75% instead of 25%. .  This is a whole number, so we will find the mean of the 6th and 7th data values: , so is 68.   Note that the median could be computed the same way, using 50%.  The 5-number summary combines the first and third quartile with the minimum, median, and maximum values.   For the 9 female sample, the median is 66, the minimum is 59, and the maximum is 72. The 5 number summary is: 59, 62, 66, 69, 72.  For the 8 female sample, the median is 65, the minimum is 59, and the maximum is 70, so the 5 number summary would be: 59, 61, 65, 68, 70.    Returning to our quiz score data. In each case, the first quartile locator is , so the first quartile will be the 3rd data value, and the third quartile will be the 8th data value. Creating the five-number summaries:  Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5; 5-number summary: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5  Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10; 5-number summary: 0, 0, 5, 10, 10  Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6; 5-number summary: 4, 4, 5, 6, 6  Section D: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10; 5-number summary: 0, 5, 5, 5, 10   Of course, with a relatively small data set, finding a five-number summary is a bit silly, since the summary contains almost as many values as the original data.  Try It Now  The total cost of textbooks for the term was collected from 36 students. Find the 5 number summary of this data.  $140 $160 $160 $165 $180 $220 $235 $240 $250 $260 $280 $285  $285 $285 $290 $300 $300 $305 $310 $310 $315 $315 $320 $320  $330 $340 $345 $350 $355 $360 $360 $380 $395 $420 $460 $460  The 5 number summary of this data is: $140, $255, $307.50, $347.50, $460    Returning to the household income data from earlier, create the five-number summary.     Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency    15  6    20  8    25  11    30  17    35  19    40  20    45  12    50  7      By adding the frequencies, we can see there are 100 data values represented in the table. In Example 20, we found the median was $35 thousand. We can see in the table that the minimum income is $15 thousand, and the maximum is $50 thousand.  To find , we calculate the locator: . This is a whole number, so will be the mean of the 25th and 26th data values.  Counting up in the data as we did before,     Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency  Values    15  6  1 - 6    20  8  7 - 14    25  11  15 - 25    30  17  26 - 42    35  19  43 - 61    40  20  62 - 81    45  12  82 - 93    50  7  94 - 100     The 25th data value is $25 thousand, and the 26th data value is $30 thousand, so will be the mean of these: thousand.  To find , we calculate the locator: . This is a whole number, so will be the mean of the 75th and 76th data values. Looking at our table above, we can see that both the 75th and 76th data values are $40 thousand, so will be $40 thousand.  Putting these values together into a five-number summary, we get: 15, 27.5, 35, 40, 50  Note that the 5 number summary divides the data into four intervals, each of which will contain about 25% of the data. In the previous example, that means about 25% of households have income between $40 thousand and $50 thousand.    For visualizing data, there is a graphical representation of a 5-number summary called a box plot, or box and whisker graph.  Box Plot  A box plot is a graphical representation of a five-number summary.   To create a box plot, a number line is first drawn. A box is drawn from the first quartile to the third quartile, and a line is drawn through the box at the median. “Whiskers” are extended out to the minimum and maximum values.   The box plot below is based on the 9 female height data with 5 number summary:  59, 62, 66, 69, 72   Image Credit: RRCC   A box is drawn from 62 to 69, with whiskers that extend from 59 to 72. A line is drawn through the box at 66.       The box plot below is based on the household income data with 5 number summary:  15, 27.5, 35, 40, 50   Image Credit: RRCC   A box is drawn from 27.5 to 40, with whiskers extending from 15 to 50. A line is drawn through the box at 35.       The box plot of service times (in minutes) for two fast-food restaurants is shown below.   Image Credit: RRCC   The box for Store 2 is drawn from 1.1 to 5.7 with whiskers extending from 0.5 to 9.6. A line goes through the box at 2.1. The box for Store 1 is drawn from 1.8 to 2.9 with whiskers extending from 0.7 to 6.3. A line goes through the box at 2.3     While store 2 had a slightly shorter median service time (2.1 minutes vs. 2.3 minutes), store 2 is less consistent, with a wider spread of the data.  At store 1, 75% of customers were served within 2.9 minutes, while at store 2, 75% of customers were served within 5.7 minutes.  Which store should you go to in a hurry? That depends upon your opinions about luck - 25% of customers at store 2 had to wait between 5.7 and 9.6 minutes.    The boxplot below is based on the birth weights (in kg) of infants with severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (SIRDS). The boxplot is separated to show the birth weights of infants who survived and those that did not.   Image Credit: RRCC   The box for those who survived goes from 1.7 to 2.9 with whiskers extending from 1.15 to 3.6. A line is drawn through the box at 2.3. The box for those who died is drawn from 1.2 to 2.25 with whiskers extending from 1.05 to 2.7. A line is drawn through the box at 1.6.     Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is the same as the third quartile of the infants that died.  Similarly, we can see that the first quartile of the survivors is larger than the median weight of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died.  Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died.  The box plot gives us a quick, albeit informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to survival of infants with SIRDS.   "

Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is the same as the third quartile of the infants that died.  Similarly, we can see that the first quartile of the survivors is larger than the median weight of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died.  Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died.  The box plot gives us a quick, albeit informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to survival of infants with SIRDS.  "

  "body": "Basic Counting    Use lists and trees to solve counting problems.  Apply the multiplication rule for counting.    We will start, however, with some more reasonable sorts of counting problems in order to develop the ideas that we will soon need.   Suppose at a particular restaurant you have three choices for an appetizer (soup, salad or breadsticks) and five choices for a main course (hamburger, sandwich, quiche, fajita or pizza). If you are allowed to choose exactly one item from each category for your meal, how many different meal options do you have?   Solution 1: One way to solve this problem would be to systematically list each possible meal:    soup + hamburger  soup + fajita  salad + sandwich  salad + pizza  breadsticks + quiche    soup + sandwich  soup + pizza  salad + quiche  breadsticks + hamburger  breadsticks + fajita    soup + quiche  salad + hamburger  salad + fajita  breadsticks + sandwich  breadsticks + pizza    Assuming that we did this systematically and that we neither missed any possibilities nor listed any possibility more than once, the answer would be 15. Thus you could go to the restaurant 15 nights in a row and have a different meal each night.  Solution 2: Another way to solve this problem would be to list all the possibilities in a table:     Hamburger  Fajita  Sandwich  Pizza  Quiche    + breadsticks  + breadsticks  + breadsticks  + breadsticks  + breadsticks    + soup  + soup  + soup  + soup  + soup    + salad  + salad  + salad  + salad  + salad     In each of the cells in the table we could list the corresponding meal: soup + hamburger in the upper left corner, salad + hamburger below it, etc. But if we didn't really care what the possible meals are, only how many possible meals there are, we could just count the number of cells and arrive at an answer of 15, which matches our answer from the first solution. (It's always good when you solve a problem two different ways and get the same answer!)  Solution 3: We already have two perfectly good solutions. Why do we need a third? The first method was not very systematic, and we might easily have made an omission. The second method was better, but suppose that in addition to the appetizer and the main course we further complicated the problem by adding desserts to the menu: we've used the rows of the table for the appetizers and the columns for the main courses—where will the desserts go? We would need a third dimension, and since drawing 3-D tables on a 2-D page or computer screen isn't terribly easy, we need a better way in case we have three categories to choose form instead of just two.  So, back to the problem in the example. What else can we do? Let's draw a tree diagram. We can abbreviate Breadsticks (B), Soup (SP), and Salad (SD) to make the tree easier to read.   A tree with five inital branches labled hamburger, fajita, pizza, sandwich, and quiche. From each of those five branches is another three branches labeled B, SP, and SD.    This is called a \"tree\" diagram because at each stage we branch out, like the branches on a tree. In this case, we first drew five branches (one for each main course) and then for each of those branches we drew three more branches (one for each appetizer). We count the number of branches at the final level and get (surprise, surprise!) 15.  If we wanted, we could instead draw three branches at the first stage for the three appetizers and then five branches (one for each main course) branching out of each of those three branches.    OK, so now we know how to count possibilities using tables and tree diagrams. These methods will continue to be useful in certain cases, but imagine a game where you have two decks of cards (with 52 cards in each deck) and you select one card from each deck. Would you really want to draw a table or tree diagram to determine the number of outcomes of this game?  Let's go back to the previous example that involved selecting a meal from three appetizers and five main courses, and look at the second solution that used a table. Notice that one way to count the number of possible meals is simply to number each of the appropriate cells in the table, as we have done above. But another way to count the number of cells in the table would be multiply the number of rows (3) by the number of columns (5) to get 15. Notice that we could have arrived at the same result without making a table at all by simply multiplying the number of choices for the appetizer (3) by the number of choices for the main course (5). We generalize this technique as the basic counting rule:  Basic Counting Rule  If we are asked to choose one item from each of two separate categories where there are items in the first category and items in the second category, then the total number of available choices is:   This is sometimes called the multiplication rule for counting.    There are 21 novels and 18 volumes of poetry on a reading list for a college English course. How many different ways can a student select one novel and one volume of poetry to read during the quarter?   There are 21 choices from the first category and 18 for the second, so there are possibilities.    The Basic Counting Rule can be extended when there are more than two categories by applying it repeatedly, as we see in the next example.   Suppose at a particular restaurant you have three choices for an appetizer (soup, salad or breadsticks), five choices for a main course (hamburger, sandwich, quiche, fajita or pasta) and two choices for dessert (pie or ice cream). If you are allowed to choose exactly one item from each category for your meal, how many different meal options do you have?   There are 3 choices for an appetizer, 5 for the main course and 2 for dessert, so there are possibilities.     A quiz consists of 3 true-or-false questions. In how many ways can a student answer the quiz?   There are 3 questions. Each question has 2 possible answers (true or false), so the quiz may be answered in different ways. Recall that another way to write is which is much more compact.    Try It Now  Suppose at a particular restaurant you have eight choices for an appetizer, eleven choices for a main course and five choices for dessert. If you are allowed to choose exactly one item from each category for your meal, how many different meal options do you have?       A keycode contains four-digits (from 0 to 9).    How many different keycodes are possible?  How many keycodes have no repeated digits?  How many keycodes only contain odd digits?       There are 10 possible numbers (0 to 9) that could be in each of the four digits of the keycode.   There are 10,000 different keycodes.  There are 10 possible numbers (0 to 9) that could be in the first digit of the keycode. The second digit has to be different from the first, so that leave 9 possible numbers for the second digit. The third digit must be different from the first two digits, so there are 8 possible numbers for the thrid digit. Using the same reasoning, that leave 7 possibilities for the fourth digit, and:   There are 5,040 keycodes that have no repeated digits.  Since all of the digits have to be odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), there are 5 possible numbers that could be in each of the four digits of the keycode.   There are 625 keycodes that only contain odd numbers.      "

If you are allowed to choose exactly one item from each category for your meal, how many different meal options do you have?   Solution 1: One way to solve this problem would be to systematically list each possible meal:    soup + hamburger  soup + fajita  salad + sandwich  salad + pizza  breadsticks + quiche    soup + sandwich  soup + pizza  salad + quiche  breadsticks + hamburger  breadsticks + fajita    soup + quiche  salad + hamburger  salad + fajita  breadsticks + sandwich  breadsticks + pizza    Assuming that we did this systematically and that we neither missed any possibilities nor listed any possibility more than once, the answer would be 15. Thus you could go to the restaurant 15 nights in a row and have a different meal each night.  Solution 2: Another way to solve this problem would be to list all the possibilities in a table:     Hamburger  Fajita  Sandwich  Pizza  Quiche    + breadsticks  + breadsticks  + breadsticks  + breadsticks  + breadsticks    + soup  + soup  + soup  + soup  + soup    + salad  + salad  + salad  + salad  + salad     In each of the cells in the table we could list the corresponding meal: soup + hamburger in the upper left corner, salad + hamburger below it, etc. But if we didn't really care what the possible meals are, only how many possible meals there are, we could just count the number of cells and arrive at an answer of 15, which matches our answer from the first solution. (It's always good when you solve a problem two different ways and get the same answer!)  Solution 3: We already have two perfectly good solutions. Why do we need a third? The first method was not very systematic, and we might easily have made an omission. The second method was better, but suppose that in addition to the appetizer and the main course we further complicated the problem by adding desserts to the menu: we've used the rows of the table for the appetizers and the columns for the main courses—where will the desserts go? We would need a third dimension, and since drawing 3-D tables on a 2-D page or computer screen isn't terribly easy, we need a better way in case we have three categories to choose form instead of just two.  So, back to the problem in the example. What else can we do? Let's draw a tree diagram. We can abbreviate Breadsticks (B), Soup (SP), and Salad (SD) to make the tree easier to read.   A tree with five inital branches labled hamburger, fajita, pizza, sandwich, and quiche. From each of those five branches is another three branches labeled B, SP, and SD.    This is called a \"tree\" diagram because at each stage we branch out, like the branches on a tree. In this case, we first drew five branches (one for each main course) and then for each of those branches we drew three more branches (one for each appetizer). We count the number of branches at the final level and get (surprise, surprise!) 15.  If we wanted, we could instead draw three branches at the first stage for the three appetizers and then five branches (one for each main course) branching out of each of those three branches.   "

  "body": " Permutations    Learn when to apply permutations to counting problems.  Apply permutations to counting problems.    In this section we will develop an even faster way to solve some of the problems we have already learned to solve by other means. Let's start with a couple examples.   How many different ways can the letters of the word MATH be rearranged to form a four-letter code word?   This problem is a bit different. Instead of choosing one item from each of several different categories, we are repeatedly choosing items from the same category (the category is: the letters of the word MATH) and each time we choose an item we do not replace it, so there is one fewer choice at the next stage: we have 4 choices for the first letter (say we choose A), then 3 choices for the second (M, T and H; say we choose H), then 2 choices for the next letter (M and T; say we choose M) and only one choice at the last stage (T). Thus there are ways to spell a code worth with the letters MATH.    In this example, we needed to calculate . This calculation shows up often in mathematics, and is called the factorial, and is notated  Factorial     How many ways can five different door prizes be distributed among five people?  There are 5 choices of prize for the first person, 4 choices for the second, and so on. The number of ways the prizes can be distributed will be ways.   Now we will consider some slightly different examples.  A charity benefit is attended by 25 people and three gift certificates are given away as door prizes: one gift certificate is in the amount of $100, the second is worth $25 and the third is worth $10. Assuming that no person receives more than one prize, how many different ways can the three gift certificates be awarded?   Using the Basic Counting Rule, there are 25 choices for the person who receives the $100 certificate, 24 remaining choices for the $25 certificate and 23 choices for the $10 certificate, so there are ways in which the prizes can be awarded.     Eight sprinters have made it to the Olympic finals in the 100-meter race. In how many different ways can the gold, silver and bronze medals be awarded?   Using the Basic Counting Rule, there are 8 choices for the gold medal winner, 7 remaining choices for the silver, and 6 for the bronze, so there are ways the three medals can be awarded to the 8 runners.    Note that in these preceding examples, the gift certificates and the Olympic medals were awarded without replacement; that is, once we have chosen a winner of the first door prize or the gold medal, they are not eligible for the other prizes. Thus, at each succeeding stage of the solution there is one fewer choice (25, then 24, then 23 in the first example; 8, then 7, then 6 in the second). Contrast this with the situation of a multiple choice test, where there might be five possible answers — A, B, C, D or E — for each question on the test.  Note also that the order of selection was important in each example: for the three door prizes, being chosen first means that you receive substantially more money; in the Olympics example, coming in first means that you get the gold medal instead of the silver or bronze. In each case, if we had chosen the same three people in a different order there might have been a different person who received the $100 prize, or a different goldmedalist. (Contrast this with the situation where we might draw three names out of a hat to each receive a $10 gift certificate; in this case the order of selection is not important since each of the three people receive the same prize. Situations where the order is not important will be discussed in the next section.)  We can generalize the situation in the two examples above to any problem without replacement where the order of selection is important. If we are arranging in order items out of possibilities (instead of 3 out of 25 or 3 out of 8 as in the previous examples), the number of possible arrangements will be given by   If you don't see why is the right number to use for the last factor, just think back to the first example in this section, where we calculated . In this case and , so , which is exactly the right number for the final factor.  Now, why would we want to use this complicated formula when it's actually easier to use the Basic Counting Rule, as we did in the first two examples? Well, we won't actually use this formula all that often, we only developed it so that we could attach a special notation and a special definition to this situation where we are choosing items out of possibilities without replacement and where the order of selection is important . In this situation we write:  Permutations  We say that there are permutations of size that may be selected from among choices without replacement when order matters.   It turns out that we can express this result more simply using factorials.    In practicality, we usually use technology rather than factorials or repeated multiplication to compute permutations.   I have nine paintings and have room to display only four of them at a time on my wall. How many different ways could I do this?   Since we are choosing 4 paintings out of 9 without replacement where the order of selection is important there are permutations.     How many ways can a four-person executive committee (president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer) be selected from a 16-member board of directors of a non-profit organization?   We want to choose 4 people out of 16 without replacement and where the order of selection is important. So the answer is .

The same argument works for any other group of three people (say Abe, Bea and David or Frank, Gloria and Hildy) so each three-person group is counted six times.

However this situation arises so frequently that we attach a special notation and a special definition to this situation where we are choosing items out of possibilities without replacement where the order of selection is not important.  Combinations   We say that there are combinations of size that may be selected from among choices without replacement where order doesn’t matter.  We can also write the combinations formula in terms of factorials:     A group of four students is to be chosen from a 35-member class to represent the class on the student council. How many ways can this be done?   Since we are choosing 4 people out of 35 without replacement where the order of selection is not important there are combinations.    Try It Now  The United States Senate Appropriations Committee consists of 29 members; the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee consists of 19 members. Disregarding party affiliation or any special seats on the Subcommittee, how many different 19-member subcommittees may be chosen from among the 29 Senators on the Appropriations Committee?  Order does not matter. possible subcommittees   In the preceding Try it Now problem we assumed that the 19 members of the Defense Subcommittee were chosen without regard to party affiliation. In reality this would never happen: if Republicans are in the majority they would never let a majority of Democrats sit on (and thus control) any subcommittee. (The same of course would be true if the Democrats were in control.) So let's consider the problem again, in a slightly more complicated form:   The United States Senate Appropriations Committee consists of 29 members, 15 Republicans and 14 Democrats. The Defense Subcommittee consists of 19 members, 10 Republicans and 9 Democrats. How many different ways can the members of the Defense Subcommittee be chosen from among the 29 Senators on the Appropriations Committee?   In this case we need to choose 10 of the 15 Republicans and 9 of the 14 Democrats. There are ways to choose the 10 Republicans and ways to choose the 9 Democrats. But now what? How do we finish the problem?  Suppose we listed all of the possible 10-member Republican groups on 3003 slips of red paper and all of the possible 9-member Democratic groups on 2002 slips of blue paper. How many ways can we choose one red slip and one blue slip? This is a job for the Basic Counting Rule! We are simply making one choice from the first category and one choice from the second category, just like in the restaurant menu problems from earlier.  There must be possible ways of selecting the members of the Defense Subcommittee.    "

  "body": "Basics    Identify events and outcomes  Define certain and impossible events  Solve probability problems involving simple events    If you roll a die, pick a card from deck of playing cards, or randomly select a person and observe their hair color, we are executing an experiment or procedure. In probability, we look at the likelihood of different outcomes. We begin with some terminology.  Events and Outcomes  The result of an experiment is called an outcome .  An event is any particular outcome or group of outcomes.  A simple event is an event that cannot be broken down further.  The sample space is the set of all possible simple events.    If we roll a standard 6-sided die, describe the sample space and some simple events.  The sample space is the set of all possible simple events: {1,2,3,4,5,6}  Some examples of simple events:  We roll a 1  We roll a 5   Some compound events:  We roll a number bigger than 4  We roll an even number     Basic Probability  Given that all outcomes are equally likely, we can compute the probability of an event using this formula:     If we roll a 6-sided die, calculate  P(rolling a 1)  P(rolling a number bigger than 4)    Recall that the sample space is {1,2,3,4,5,6}    There is one outcome corresponding to “rolling a 1”, so the probability is  There are two outcomes bigger than a 4, so the probability is     Probabilities are essentially fractions, and can be reduced to lower terms like fractions.   Let's say you have a bag with 20 cherries, 14 sweet and 6 sour. If you pick a cherry at random, what is the probability that it will be sweet?   There are 20 possible cherries that could be picked, so the number of possible outcomes is 20. Of these 20 possible outcomes, 14 are favorable (sweet), so the probability that the cherry will be sweet is     There is one potential complication to this example, however. It must be assumed that the probability of picking any of the cherries is the same as the probability of picking any other. This wouldn't be true if (let us imagine) the sweet cherries are smaller than the sour ones. (The sour cherries would come to hand more readily when you sampled from the bag.) Let us keep in mind, therefore, that when we assess probabilities in terms of the ratio of favorable to all potential cases, we rely heavily on the assumption of equal probability for all outcomes.  Try It Now  At some random moment, you look at your clock and note the minutes reading.  What is probability the minutes reading is 15?  What is the probability the minutes reading is 15 or less?            Cards  A standard deck of 52 playing cards consists of four suits (hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs). Spades and clubs are black while hearts and diamonds are red. Each suit contains 13 cards, each of a different rank: an Ace (which in many games functions as both a low card and a high card), cards numbered 2 through 10, a Jack, a Queen and a King.    Compute the probability of randomly drawing one card from a deck and getting an Ace.   There are 52 cards in the deck and 4 Aces so   We can also think of probabilities as percents: There is a 7.69% chance that a randomly selected card will be an Ace.    Notice that the smallest possible probability is 0 - if there are no outcomes that correspond with the event. The largest possible probability is 1 - if all possible outcomes correspond with the event.  Certain and Impossible events  An impossible event has a probability of 0.  A certain event has a probability of 1.  The probability of any event must be .

  "body": "   Find probability of complementary events  Identify independent events  Solve probability problems involving independent events    Working with Events  Complementary Events  Now let us examine the probability that an event does not happen. As in the previous section, consider the situation of rolling a six-sided die and first compute the probability of rolling a six: the answer is . Now consider the probability that we do not roll a six: there are 5 outcomes that are not a six, so the answer is . Notice that   This is not a coincidence. Consider a generic situation with possible outcomes and an event that corresponds to of these outcomes. Then the remaining outcomes correspond to not happening, thus   Complement of an Event  The complement of an event is the event “E doesn’t happen”  The notation is used for the complement of event .  We can compute the probability of the complement using .  Notice also that    If you pull a random card from a deck of playing cards, what is the probability it is not a heart?   There are 13 hearts in the deck, so .  The probability of not drawing a heart is the complement:      Probability of two independent events   Suppose we flipped a coin and rolled a die, and wanted to know the probability of getting a head on the coin and a 6 on the die.   We could list all possible outcomes: {H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6}  Notice there are total outcomes. Out of these, only 1 is the desired outcome, so the probability is .    The prior example was looking at two independent events.  Independent Events  Events A and B are independent events if the probability of Event B occurring is the same whether or not Event A occurs.    Are these events independent?  A fair coin is tossed two times. The two events are (1) first toss is a head and (2) second toss is a head.  The two events (1) \"It will rain tomorrow in Houston\" and (2) \"It will rain tomorrow in Galveston” (a city near Houston).  You draw a card from a deck, then draw a second card without replacing the first.      The probability that a head comes up on the second toss is regardless of whether or not a head came up on the first toss, so these events are independent.  These events are not independent because it is more likely that it will rain in Galveston on days it rains in Houston than on days it does not.  The probability of the second card being red depends on whether the first card is red or not, so these events are not independent.     When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events.  P( and ) for Independent Events  If events and are independent, then the probability of both and occurring is   where is the probability of events and both occurring, is the probability of event occurring, and is the probability of event occurring.   If you look back at the coin and die example from earlier, you can see how the number of outcomes of the first event multiplied by the number of outcomes in the second event multiplied to equal the total number of possible outcomes in the combined event.   In your drawer you have 10 pairs of socks, 6 of which are white, and 7 tee shirts, 3 of which are white. If you randomly reach in and pull out a pair of socks and a tee shirt, what is the probability both are white?   The probability of choosing a white pair of socks is . The probability of choosing a white tee shirt is . The probability of both being white is     Try It Now  A card is pulled a deck of cards and noted. The card is then replaced, the deck is shuffled, and a second card is removed and noted. What is the probability that both cards are Aces?    The previous examples looked at the probability of both events occurring. Now we will look at the probability of either event occurring.   Suppose we flipped a coin and rolled a die, and wanted to know the probability of getting a head on the coin or a 6 on the die.   Here, there are still 12 possible outcomes: {H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6,T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6}  By simply counting, we can see that 7 of the outcomes have a head on the coin or a 6 on the die or both - we use or inclusively here (these 7 outcomes are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, T6), so the probability is . How could we have found this from the individual probabilities?  As we would expect, of these outcomes have a head, and of these outcomes have a 6 on the die. If we add these, , which is not the correct probability.  Looking at the outcomes we can see why: the outcome H6 would have been counted twice, since it contains both a head and a 6; the probability of both a head and rolling a 6 is . If we subtract out this double count, we have the correct probability:     P(A or B)  The probability of either A or B occurring (or both) is     Suppose we draw one card from a standard deck. What is the probability that we get a Queen or a King?   There are 4 Queens and 4 Kings in the deck, hence 8 outcomes corresponding to a Queen or King out of 52 possible outcomes. Thus the probability of drawing a Queen or a King is:  P(King or Queen) =  Note that in this case, there are no cards that are both a Queen and a King, so P(King and Queen) = 0. Using our probability rule, we could have said:  (King or Queen) (King) (Queen) (King and Queen)    In the last example, the events were mutually exclusive, so P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).   Suppose we draw one card from a standard deck. What is the probability that we get a red card or a King?   Half the cards are red, so  There are four kings, so  There are two red kings, so  We can then calculate     Try It Now  In your drawer you have 10 pairs of socks, 6 of which are white, and 7 tee shirts, 3 of which are white. If you reach in and randomly grab a pair of socks and a tee shirt, what the probability at least one is white?   P(white sock and white tee) =  P(white sock or white tee) =     The table below shows the number of survey subjects who have received and not received a speeding ticket in the last year, and the color of their car.

Notice that having a red car and getting a speeding ticket are not independent events, so the probability of both of them occurring is not simply the product of probabilities of each one occurring.   We could answer this question by simply adding up the numbers: 15 people with red cars and speeding tickets + 135 with red cars but no ticket + 45 with a ticket but no red car = 195 people. So the probability is .  We also could have found this probability by:  P(had a red car) + P(got a speeding ticket) - P(had a red car and got a speeding ticket)= .       "

  "body": "   Solve conditional probability problems  Apply Bayes Theorem to conditional probability problems    Conditional Probability  Often it is required to compute the probability of an event given that another event has occurred.  Conditional Probability   What is the probability that two cards drawn at random from a deck of playing cards will both be aces?   It might seem that you could use the formula for the probability of two independent events and simply multiply .  This would be incorrect, however, because the two events are not independent. If the first card drawn is an ace, then the probability that the second card is also an ace would be lower because there would only be three aces left in the deck.  Once the first card chosen is an ace, the probability that the second card chosen is also an ace is called the conditional probability of drawing an ace. In this case the \"condition\" is that the first card is an ace. Symbolically, we write this as:  P(ace on second draw | an ace on the first draw).  The vertical bar \"|\" is read as \"given,\" so the above expression is short for \"The probability that an ace is drawn on the second draw given that an ace was drawn on the first draw.\" What is this probability? After an ace is drawn on the first draw, there are 3 aces out of 51 total cards left. This means that the conditional probability of drawing an ace after one ace has already been drawn is .  Thus, the probability of both cards being aces is .    Conditional Probability  The probability the event B occurs, given that event A has happened, is represented as:   This is read as “the probability of B given A”    Find the probability that a die rolled shows a 6, given that a flipped coin shows a head.   These are two independent events, so the probability of the die rolling a 6 is , regardless of the result of the coin flip.     The table below shows the number of survey subjects who have received and not received a speeding ticket in the last year, and the color of their car. Find the probability that a randomly chosen person:  Has a speeding ticket given they have a red car.  Has a red car given they have a speeding ticket.

Of those, 15 have a speeding ticket, so     Since we know the person has a speeding ticket, we are only considering the 60 people in the first column of the table. Of those, 15 have a red car, so       Notice from the last example that is not equal to .  These kinds of conditional probabilities are what insurance companies use to determine your insurance rates. They look at the conditional probability of you having accident, given your age, your car, your car color, your driving history, etc., and price your policy based on that likelihood.  Conditional Probability Formula  If Events A and B are not independent, then     If you pull 2 cards out of a deck, what is the probability that both are spades?   The probability that the first card is a spade is .  The probability that the second card is a spade, given the first was a spade, is , since there is one less spade in the deck, and one less total cards.  The probability that both cards are spades is     If you draw two cards from a deck, what is the probability that you will get the Ace of Diamonds and a black card?   You can satisfy this condition by having Case A or Case B, as follows:  Case A) you can get the Ace of Diamonds first and then a black card or  Case B) you can get a black card first and then the Ace of Diamonds.  Let's calculate the probability of Case A. The probability that the first card is the Ace of Diamonds is . The probability that the second card is black given that the first card is the Ace of Diamonds is because 26 of the remaining 51 cards are black. The probability is therefore .  Now for Case B: the probability that the first card is black is . The probability that the second card is the Ace of Diamonds given that the first card is black is . The probability of Case B is therefore , the same as the probability of Case 1.  Recall that the probability of A or B is and n this problem, since the first card cannot be the Ace of Diamonds and be a black card. Therefore, the probability of Case A or Case B is .  The probability that you will get the Ace of Diamonds and a black card when drawing two cards from a deck is .    Try It Now  In your drawer you have 10 pairs of socks, 6 of which are white. If you reach in and randomly grab two pairs of socks, what is the probability that both are white?     A home pregnancy test was given to women, then pregnancy was verified through blood tests. The following table shows the home pregnancy test results.

P(not pregnant | positive test result) =    Since we know the woman is not pregnant, we are limited to the 19 women in the second row, of which 5 had a positive test.  P(positive test result | not pregnant) =   The second result is what is usually called a false positive: A positive result when the woman is not actually pregnant.      Bayes Theorem  Let's look at more complex conditional probability problems.   Suppose a certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.1% (that is, it afflicts 0.1% of the population). A test has been devised to detect this disease. The test does not produce false negatives (that is, anyone who has the disease will test positive for it), but the false positive rate is 5% (that is, about 5% of people who take the test will test positive, even though they do not have the disease). Suppose a randomly selected person takes the test and tests positive. What is the probability that this person actually has the disease?   There are two ways to approach the solution to this problem. One involves an important result in probability theory called Bayes' theorem. We will discuss this theorem a bit later, but for now we will use an alternative and, we hope, much more intuitive approach.  Let's break down the information in the problem piece by piece.  Suppose a certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.1% (that is, it afflicts 0.1% of the population). The percentage 0.1% can be converted to a decimal number by moving the decimal place two places to the left, to get 0.001. In turn, 0.001 can be rewritten as a fraction: 1\/1000. This tells us that about 1 in every 1000 people has the disease. (If we wanted we could write P(disease)=0.001.)  A test has been devised to detect this disease. The test does not produce false negatives (that is, anyone who has the disease will test positive for it). This part is fairly straightforward: everyone who has the disease will test positive, or alternatively everyone who tests negative does not have the disease. (We could also say P(positive | disease)=1.)  The false positive rate is 5% (that is, about 5% of people who take the test will test positive, even though they do not have the disease). This is even more straightforward. Another way of looking at it is that of every 100 people who are tested and do not have the disease, 5 will test positive even though they do not have the disease. (We could also say that P(positive | no disease)=0.05.)  Suppose a randomly selected person takes the test and tests positive. What is the probability that this person actually has the disease? Here we want to compute P(disease|positive). We already know that P(positive|disease)=1, but remember that conditional probabilities are not equal if the conditions are switched.  Rather than thinking in terms of all these probabilities we have developed, let's create a hypothetical situation and apply the facts as set out above. First, suppose we randomly select 1000 people and administer the test. How many do we expect to have the disease? Since about 1\/1000 of all people are afflicted with the disease, of 1000 people is 1. (Now you know why we chose 1000.) Only 1 of 1000 test subjects actually has the disease; the other 999 do not.  We also know that 5% of all people who do not have the disease will test positive. There are 999 disease-free people, so we would expect (so, about 50) people to test positive who do not have the disease.  Now back to the original question, computing P(disease|positive). There are 51 people who test positive in our example (the one unfortunate person who actually has the disease, plus the 50 people who tested positive but don't). Only one of these people has the disease, so or less than 2%. Does this surprise you? This means that of all people who test positive, over 98% do not have the disease.  The answer we got was slightly approximate, since we rounded 49.95 to 50. We could redo the problem with 100,000 test subjects, 100 of whom would have the disease and test positive but do not have the disease, so the exact probability of having the disease if you test positive is which is pretty much the same answer.    But back to the surprising result. Of all people who test positive, over 98% do not have the disease. If your guess for the probability a person who tests positive has the disease was wildly different from the right answer (2%), don't feel bad. The exact same problem was posed to doctors and medical students at the Harvard Medical School 25 years ago and the results revealed in a 1978 New England Journal of Medicine article. Only about 18% of the participants got the right answer. Most of the rest thought the answer was closer to 95% (perhaps they were misled by the false positive rate of 5%).  So at least you should feel a little better that a bunch of doctors didn't get the right answer either (assuming you thought the answer was much higher). But the significance of this finding and similar results from other studies in the intervening years lies not in making math students feel better but in the possibly catastrophic consequences it might have for patient care. If a doctor thinks the chances that a positive test result nearly guarantees that a patient has a disease, they might begin an unnecessary and possibly harmful treatment regimen on a healthy patient. Or worse, as in the early days of the AIDS crisis when being HIV-positive was often equated with a death sentence, the patient might take a drastic action and commit suicide.  As we have seen in this hypothetical example, the most responsible course of action for treating a patient who tests positive would be to counsel the patient that they most likely do not have the disease and to order further, more reliable, tests to verify the diagnosis.  One of the reasons that the doctors and medical students in the study did so poorly is that such problems, when presented in the types of statistics courses that medical students often take, are solved by use of Bayes' theorem, which is stated as follows.  Bayes’ Theorem  Bayes' Theorem is:    In our earlier example, this translates to   Plugging in the numbers gives which is exactly the same answer as our original solution.  The problem is that you (or the typical medical student, or even the typical math professor) are much more likely to be able to remember the original solution than to remember Bayes' theorem. Psychologists, such as Gerd Gigerenzer, author of Calculated Risks: How to Know When Numbers Deceive You, have advocated that the method involved in the original solution (which Gigerenzer calls the method of \"natural frequencies\") be employed in place of Bayes' Theorem. Gigerenzer performed a study and found that those educated in the natural frequency method were able to recall it far longer than those who were taught Bayes' theorem. When one considers the possible life-and-death consequences associated with such calculations it seems wise to heed his advice.   A certain disease has an incidence rate of 2%. If the false negative rate is 10% and the false positive rate is 1%, compute the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease.   Imagine 10,000 people who are tested. Of these 10,000, 200 will have the disease; 10% of them, or 20, will test negative and the remaining 180 will test positive. Of the 9800 who do not have the disease, 98 will test positive. So of the 278 total people who test positive, 180 will have the disease. Thus so about 65% of the people who test positive will have the disease.  Using Bayes theorem directly would give the same result:     Try It Now  A certain disease has an incidence rate of 0.5%. If there are no false negatives and if the false positive rate is 3%, compute the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease.  Out of 100,000 people, 500 would have the disease. Of those, all 500 would test positive. Of the 99,500 without the disease, 2,985 would falsely test positive and the other 96,515 would test negative.  P(disease|positive)=     "

It might seem that you could use the formula for the probability of two independent events and simply multiply .  This would be incorrect, however, because the two events are not independent. If the first card drawn is an ace, then the probability that the second card is also an ace would be lower because there would only be three aces left in the deck.  Once the first card chosen is an ace, the probability that the second card chosen is also an ace is called the conditional probability of drawing an ace.

The vertical bar \"|\" is read as \"given,\" so the above expression is short for \"The probability that an ace is drawn on the second draw given that an ace was drawn on the first draw.\" What is this probability? After an ace is drawn on the first draw, there are 3 aces out of 51 total cards left. This means that the conditional probability of drawing an ace after one ace has already been drawn is .

A 4 digit PIN number is selected. What is the probability that there are no repeated digits?   There are 10 possible values for each digit of the PIN (namely: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), so there are total possible PIN numbers.  To have no repeated digits, all four digits would have to be different, which is selecting without replacement. We could either compute , or notice that this is the same as the permutation .  The probability of no repeated digits is the number of 4 digit PIN numbers with no repeated digits divided by the total number of 4 digit PIN numbers. This probability is .     In a certain state's lottery, 48 balls numbered 1 through 48 are placed in a machine and six of them are drawn at random. If the six numbers drawn match the numbers that a player had chosen, the player wins $1,000,000. In this lottery, the order the numbers are drawn in doesn’t matter. Compute the probability that you win the million-dollar prize if you purchase a single lottery ticket.   In order to compute the probability, we need to count the total number of ways six numbers can be drawn, and the number of ways the six numbers on the player’s ticket could match the six numbers drawn from the machine. Since there is no stipulation that the numbers be in any particular order, the number of possible outcomes of the lottery drawing is . Of these possible outcomes, only one would match all six numbers on the player’s ticket, so the probability of winning the grand prize is:      In the state lottery from the previous example, if five of the six numbers drawn match the numbers that a player has chosen, the player wins a second prize of $1,000. Compute the probability that you win the second prize if you purchase a single lottery ticket.   As above, the number of possible outcomes of the lottery drawing is . In order to win the second prize, five of the six numbers on the ticket must match five of the six winning numbers; in other words, we must have chosen five of the six winning numbers and one of the 42 losing numbers. The number of ways to choose 5 out of the 6 winning numbers is given by and the number of ways to choose 1 out of the 42 losing numbers is given by . Thus the number of favorable outcomes is then given by the Basic Counting Rule: .  So the probability of winning the second prize is    Try It Now  A multiple-choice question on an economics quiz contains 10 questions with five possible answers each. Compute the probability of randomly guessing the answers and getting 9 questions correct.  There are different ways the exam can be answered. There are 10 possible locations for the one missed question, and in each of those locations there are 4 wrong answers, so there are 40 ways the test could be answered with one wrong answer.  P(9 answers correct)= chance.     Compute the probability of randomly drawing five cards from a deck and getting exactly one Ace.   In many card games (such as poker) the order in which the cards are drawn is not important (since the player may rearrange the cards in his hand any way he chooses); in the problems that follow, we will assume that this is the case unless otherwise stated. Thus we use combinations to compute the possible number of 5-card hands, . This number will go in the denominator of our probability formula, since it is the number of possible outcomes.  For the numerator, we need the number of ways to draw one Ace and four other cards (none of them Aces) from the deck. Since there are four Aces and we want exactly one of them, there will be ways to select one Ace; since there are 48 non-Aces and we want 4 of them, there will be ways to select the four non-Aces. Now we use the Basic Counting Rule to calculate that there will be ways to choose one ace and four non-Aces.  Putting this all together, we have P(one Ace)     Compute the probability of randomly drawing five cards from a deck and getting exactly two Aces.   The solution is similar to the previous example, except now we are choosing 2 Aces out of 4 and 3 non- Aces out of 48; the denominator remains the same:  P(two Aces)=    It is useful to note that these card problems are remarkably similar to the lottery problems discussed earlier.  Try It Now  Compute the probability of randomly drawing five cards from a deck of cards and getting three Aces and two Kings.    Let's take a pause to consider a famous problem in probability theory:  Suppose you have a room full of 30 people. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday?  Take a guess at the answer to the above problem. Was your guess fairly low, like around 10%? That seems to be the intuitive answer ( , perhaps?). Let's see if we should listen to our intuition. Let's start with a simpler problem, however.   Suppose three people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday among these three people?   There are a lot of ways there could be at least one shared birthday. Fortunately there is an easier way. We ask ourselves “What is the alternative to having at least one shared birthday?” In this case, the alternative is that there are no shared birthdays. In other words, the alternative to “at least one” is having none. In other words, since this is a complementary event,  P(at least one)=1-P(none)  We will start, then, by computing the probability that there is no shared birthday. Let's imagine that you are one of these three people. Your birthday can be anything without conflict, so there are 365 choices out of 365 for your birthday. What is the probability that the second person does not share your birthday? There are 365 days in the year (let's ignore leap years) and removing your birthday from contention, there are 364 choices that will guarantee that you do not share a birthday with this person, so the probability that the second person does not share your birthday is .  Now we move to the third person. What is the probability that this third person does not have the same birthday as either you or the second person? There are 363 days that will not duplicate your birthday or the second person's, so the probability that the third person does not share a birthday with the first two is .  We want the second person not to share a birthday with you and the third person not to share a birthday with the first two people, so we use the multiplication rule:  P(no shared birthday)=  and then subtract from 1 to get  P(shared birthday)= 1 - P(no shared birthday)= .  This is a pretty small number, so maybe it makes sense that the answer to our original problem will be small. Let's make our group a bit bigger.     Suppose five people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday among these five people?   Continuing the pattern of the previous example, the answer should be  P(shared birthday)=  Note that we could rewrite this more compactly as P(shared birthday)= which makes it a bit easier to type into a calculator or computer, and which suggests a nice formula as we continue to expand the population of our group.     Suppose 30 people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday among these 30 people?   Here we can calculate P(shared birthday)=  which gives us the surprising result that when you are in a room with 30 people there is a 70% chance that there will be at least one shared birthday!    If you like to bet, and if you can convince 30 people to reveal their birthdays, you might be able to win some money by betting a friend that there will be at least two people with the same birthday in the room anytime you are in a room of 30 or more people. (Of course, you would need to make sure your friend hasn't studied probability!) You wouldn't be guaranteed to win, but you should win more than half the time.  Try It Now  Suppose 10 people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday among these 10 people?  P(shared birthday)=   "

  "body": " Compute the probability of randomly drawing five cards from a deck and getting exactly one Ace.   In many card games (such as poker) the order in which the cards are drawn is not important (since the player may rearrange the cards in his hand any way he chooses); in the problems that follow, we will assume that this is the case unless otherwise stated. Thus we use combinations to compute the possible number of 5-card hands, . This number will go in the denominator of our probability formula, since it is the number of possible outcomes.  For the numerator, we need the number of ways to draw one Ace and four other cards (none of them Aces) from the deck. Since there are four Aces and we want exactly one of them, there will be ways to select one Ace; since there are 48 non-Aces and we want 4 of them, there will be ways to select the four non-Aces. Now we use the Basic Counting Rule to calculate that there will be ways to choose one ace and four non-Aces.  Putting this all together, we have P(one Ace)   "

  "body": " Suppose three people are in a room. What is the probability that there is at least one shared birthday among these three people?   There are a lot of ways there could be at least one shared birthday. Fortunately there is an easier way. We ask ourselves “What is the alternative to having at least one shared birthday?” In this case, the alternative is that there are no shared birthdays. In other words, the alternative to “at least one” is having none. In other words, since this is a complementary event,  P(at least one)=1-P(none)  We will start, then, by computing the probability that there is no shared birthday. Let's imagine that you are one of these three people. Your birthday can be anything without conflict, so there are 365 choices out of 365 for your birthday. What is the probability that the second person does not share your birthday? There are 365 days in the year (let's ignore leap years) and removing your birthday from contention, there are 364 choices that will guarantee that you do not share a birthday with this person, so the probability that the second person does not share your birthday is .  Now we move to the third person. What is the probability that this third person does not have the same birthday as either you or the second person? There are 363 days that will not duplicate your birthday or the second person's, so the probability that the third person does not share a birthday with the first two is .  We want the second person not to share a birthday with you and the third person not to share a birthday with the first two people, so we use the multiplication rule:  P(no shared birthday)=  and then subtract from 1 to get  P(shared birthday)= 1 - P(no shared birthday)= .  This is a pretty small number, so maybe it makes sense that the answer to our original problem will be small. Let's make our group a bit bigger.   "

  "title": "Expected Value",
  "body": "Expected Value    Compute expected values    Expected value is perhaps the most useful probability concept we will discuss. It has many applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's one thing that the casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries hope most people never learn about.   In the casino game roulette, a wheel with 38 spaces (18 red, 18 black, and 2 green) is spun. In one possible bet, the player bets $1 on a single number. If that number is spun on the wheel, then they receive $36 (their original $1 + $35). Otherwise, they lose their $1. On average, how much money should a player expect to win or lose if they play this game repeatedly?   Suppose you bet $1 on each of the 38 spaces on the wheel, for a total of $38 bet. When the winning number is spun, you are paid $36 on that number. While you won on that one number, overall you’ve lost $2. On a per-space basis, you have “won” - $2\/$38 = -$0.053. In other words, on average you lose 5.3 cents per space you bet on.    We call this average gain or loss the expected value of playing roulette. Notice that no one ever loses exactly 5.3 cents: most people (in fact, about 37 out of every 38) lose $1 and a very few people (about 1 person out of every 38) gain $35 (the $36 they win minus the $1 they spent to play the game).  There is another way to compute expected value without imagining what would happen if we play every possible space. There are 38 possible outcomes when the wheel spins, so the probability of winning is . The complement, the probability of losing, is .  Summarizing these along with the values, we get this table:     Outcome  Probability of Outcome    $35     -$1      Notice that if we multiply each outcome by its corresponding probability we get and , and if we add these numbers we get , which is the expected value we computed above.  Expected Value  Expected Value is the average gain or loss of an event if the procedure is repeated many times.  We can compute the expected value by multiplying each outcome by the probability of that outcome, then adding up the products.   Try It Now  You purchase a raffle ticket to help out a charity. The raffle ticket costs $5. The charity is selling 2000 tickets. One of them will be drawn and the person holding the ticket will be given a prize worth $4000. Compute the expected value for this raffle.      In a certain state's lottery, 48 balls numbered 1 through 48 are placed in a machine and six of them are drawn at random. If the six numbers drawn match the numbers that a player had chosen, the player wins $1,000,000. If they match 5 numbers, then win $1,000. It costs $1 to buy a ticket. Find the expected value.   Earlier, we calculated the probability of matching all 6 numbers and the probability of matching 5 numbers:  for all 6 numbers,   for 5 numbers.  Our probabilities and outcome values are:     Outcome  Probability of Outcome    $999,999     $999     -$1      The expected value, then is:   On average, one can expect to lose about 90 cents on a lottery ticket. Of course, most players will lose $1.    In general, if the expected value of a game is negative, it is not a good idea to play the game, since on average you will lose money. It would be better to play a game with a positive expected value (good luck trying to find one!), although keep in mind that even if the average winnings are positive it could be the case that most people lose money and one very fortunate individual wins a great deal of money. If the expected value of a game is 0, we call it a fair game, since neither side has an advantage.  Not surprisingly, the expected value for casino games is negative for the player, which is positive for the casino. It must be positive or they would go out of business. Players just need to keep in mind that when they play a game repeatedly, their expected value is negative. That is fine so long as you enjoy playing the game and think it is worth the cost. But it would be wrong to expect to come out ahead.  Try It Now  A friend offers to play a game, in which you roll 3 standard 6-sided dice. If all the dice roll different values, you give him $1. If any two dice match values, you get $2. What is the expected value of this game? Would you play?  Suppose you roll the first die. The probability the second will be different is . The probability that the third roll is different than the previous two is , so the probability that the three dice are different is . The probability that two dice will match is the complement, .  The expected value is: .  Yes, it is in your advantage to play. On average, you’d win $0.33 per play.    Expected value also has applications outside of gambling. Expected value is very common in making insurance decisions.   A 40-year-old man in the U.S. has a 0.242% risk of dying during the next year. An insurance company charges $275 for a life-insurance policy that pays a $100,000 death benefit. What is the expected value for the person buying the insurance?   The probabilities and outcomes are     Outcome  Probability of Outcome             The expected value is .    Not surprisingly, the expected value is negative; the insurance company can only afford to offer policies if they, on average, make money on each policy. They can afford to pay out the occasional benefit because they offer enough policies that those benefit payouts are balanced by the rest of the insured people.  For people buying the insurance, there is a negative expected value, but there is a security that comes from insurance that is worth that cost.  "

Compute the probability that a 5-card poker hand is dealt to you that contains all hearts.    Compute the probability that a 5-card poker hand is dealt to you that contains four Aces.    A bag contains 3 gold marbles, 6 silver marbles, and 28 black marbles. Someone offers to play this game: You randomly select on marble from the bag. If it is gold, you win $3. If it is silver, you win $2. If it is black, you lose $1. What is your expected value if you play this game?  -$0.19   A friend devises a game that is played by rolling a single six-sided die once. If you roll a 6, he pays you $3; if you roll a 5, he pays you nothing; if you roll a number less than 5, you pay him $1. Compute the expected value for this game. Should you play this game?    In a lottery game, a player picks six numbers from 1 to 23. If the player matches all six numbers, they win 30,000 dollars. Otherwise, they lose $1. Find the expected value of this game.  -$0.70   A game is played by picking two cards from a standard deck. If they are the same suit, then you win $5, otherwise you lose $1. What is the expected value of this game?    A company estimates that 0.7% of their products will fail after the original warranty period but within 2 years of the purchase, with a replacement cost of $350. If they offer a 2 year extended warranty for $48, what is the company's expected value of each warranty sold?  $45.55   An insurance company estimates the probability of an earthquake in the next year to be 0.0013. The average damage done by an earthquake it estimates to be $60,000. If the company offers earthquake insurance for $100, what is their expected value of the policy?    A magazine subscription is having a contest in which the price is $80,000. If the company receives 1 million entries, what is the expected value of an entry in the contest?  $0.08   In a game show, four prizes are hidden on a board that contains 20 spaces. One prize is worth $15,000, two are worth $5,000 and the other prize is worth $1,000. The remaining spaces contain no prizes. The game show host offers a guaranteed prize of $1,000 not to play this game. Use expected value to determine whether the contestant should choose the guaranteed $1,000 or play the game?    A game involves drawing a single card from a standard deck of 52 cards. If an ace is drawn you ge $0.50; if a face card is drawn you get $0.25; if the 2 of clubs is drawn you get $1. If the cost of playing is $0.10, should you play the game?  You should play the game, because the EV > 0. (It is $0.015)   The SAT is a multiple-choice test. Each question has five possible choices. The test taker must select one answer for each question or leave the question blank. One point is award for each correct answer and -1\/4 point is subtracted for each incorrect answer. (No points are added or subtracted for questions that are left blank.)  What is the expected value of randomly guessing the answer to a question  If you can eliminate one of the choices, what is the expected value of randomly guessing among the remaining four choices? Is it a good strategy to guess? Why or why not?     A construction company is planning to bid on a building contract. The bid cost the company $1200. the probability that the bid is accepted is 0.2. If the bid is accepted the company will make $40,000 minus the cost of the bid. Find the expected value of the making the bid.   "

  "title": "Understanding Normal Distributions",
  "body": " Understanding Normal Distributions    Introduce and discover properities of normal distributions    If you knew that the prices of t-shirts sold in an online shopping site were normally distributed , and had a mean cost of $10, with a standard deviation of $1.50, how could that information benefit you as you are looking at various t-shirt prices on the site? How could you use what you know if you were looking to make a profit by purchasing unusually inexpensive shirts to resell at prices that are more common?  The Normal Distribution  A distribution is an evaluation of the way that points in a data set are clustered or spread across their range of values. A normal distribution is a very specific symmetrical distribution that indicates, among other things, that exactly of the data is below the mean, and is above, that approximately 68% of the data is within 1, approximately 95% of the data is within 2, and approximately 99.7% is within 3 standard deviations of the mean.  There are a number of reasons that it is important to become familiar with the normal distribution, as you will discover throughout this chapter. Examples of values associated with normal distribution:    Physical characteristics such as height, weight, arm or leg length, etc.  The percentile rankings of standardized testing such as the ACT and SAT  The volume of water produced by a river on a monthly or yearly basis  The velocity of molecules in an ideal gas   Knowing that the values in a set are exactly or approximately normally distributed allows you to get a feel for how common a particular value might be in that set. Because the values of a normal distribution are predictably clustered around the mean, you can estimate in short order the rarity of a given value in the set. In our upcoming lesson on the Empirical Rule, you will see that it is worth memorizing that normally distributed data has the characteristics mentioned above:    50% of all data points are above the mean and 50% are below  Approximately 68% of all data points are within 1 standard deviation of the mean  Approximately 95% of all data points are within 2 standard deviations of the mean  Approximately 99.7% of all data points are within 3 standard deviations of the mean   In this lesson, we will be practicing a ‘rough estimate’ of the probability that a value within a given range will occur in a particular set of data, just to develop an intuition of the use of a normal distribution. In subsequent lessons, we will become more specific with our estimates. The image below will be used in greater detail in the lesson on the Empirical Rule, but you may use it as a reference for this lesson also.   Image Credit: RRCC   A bell curve with standard deviations from the mean (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3) on the horizontal axis. The region from -3 to -2 is labeled as 2.35%, -2 to -1 is 13.5%, -1 to 0 is 34%, 0 to 1 is 34%, 1 to 2 is 13.5% and 2 to 3 is 2.35%      Examples     Human height is commonly considered an approximately normally distributed measure. If the mean height of a male adult in the U.S.A. is 5'10\", with a standard deviation of 1.5\", how common are men with heights greater than 6'2\"?  Since each standard deviation of this normally distributed data is 1.5\", and 6'2\" is 4\" above the mean for the population, 6'2\" is nearly 3 standard deviations above the mean. That tells us that men taller than 6'2\" are quite rare in this population.    If the fuel mileage of a particular model of car is normally distributed, with a mean of 26 mpg and a standard deviation of 2 mpg, how common are cars with a fuel efficiency of 24 to 25 mpg?  We know that approximately 68% of the cars in the population have an efficiency of between 24 and 28 mpg, since that would be 1 SD below and 1 SD above the mean. That suggests that apx 34% have an efficiency of 24 to 26 mpg, so we can say that it is uncommon to see a car with an efficiency between 24 and 25 mpg, but not extremely so.    If the maximum jumping height of U.S. high school high jumpers is normally distributed with a mean of 5'11.5\" and a SD of 2.2\", how unusual is it to see a high school jumper clear 6'3\"?  If the mean is 5'11.5\", then 1 SD above is 6'1.7\" and 2 SD’s is 6'3.9\". That means that less than 2.5% of jumpers 6'3.9\", so it would be pretty uncommon to see a high-school competitor exceed 6'3\".    For the examples below assume the data to be normally distributed, and describe the rarity of an event using the following scale:    0% - < 1% probability = very rare  1% - < 5% = rare  5% - < 34% = uncommon  34% - < 50% = common  50% - 100% = likely    If the mean ( ) of the data is 75, and the standard deviation ( ) is 5, how common is a value between 70 and 75?  A value of 70 is only 1 standard deviation below the mean, so a value between 70 and 75 would be expected approximately 34% of the time, so it would be common.     If the is .02 and the standard deviation is .005, how common is a value between .005 and .01?  A value of .01 is 2 SD's below the mean, and .005 is 3 SD's below, so we would expect there to be about a 2.5% probability of a value occurring in that range. A value between 0.005 and 0.01 would be rare.    Try It Now  If the mean is 1280 and the standard deviation is 70, how common is a value between 1210 and 1350?  1210 is 1 SD below the mean, and 1350 is 1 SD above the mean, so we would expect approximately 68% of the data to be in that range, meaning that is it likely that a value in that range would occur.    If the mean defect rate at a cellphone production plant is 0.1%, with a standard deviation of 0.03%, would it seem reasonable for a quality assurance manager to be concerned about 3 defective phones in a single 1000 unit run?   0.1% translates into 1 per thousand, with a standard deviation of 3 per ten thousand. That means that 3 defects in the same thousand is nearly 7 SD’s above the mean, well into the very rare category. While it is not impossible for random chance to result in such a value, it would certainly be prudent for the manager to investigate.    Returning to the problem, we started with:  If you knew that the prices of t-shirts sold in an online shopping site were normally distributed, and had a mean cost of $10, with a standard deviation of $1.50, how could that information benefit you as you are looking at various t-shirt styles and designs on the site? How could you use what you know if you were looking to make a profit by purchasing unusually inexpensive shirts to resell at prices that are more common?  By knowing the mean and SD of the shirt prices, and knowing that they are normally distributed, you can estimate right away if a shirt is priced at a point significantly below the norm. For instance, with this data, we can estimate that a shirt priced at $7.00 is less expensive than apx 97.5% of all shirts on the site, and could likely be resold at a profit (assuming there is not something wrong the shirt that is not obvious from the listing).

  "body": " The Empirical Rule    Use the empirical rule to find probabilities    If the price per pound of USDA Choice Beef is normally distributed with a mean of $4.85\/lb and a standard deviation of $0.35\/lb, what is the estimated probability that a randomly chosen sample (from a randomly chosen market) will be between $5.20 and $5.55 per pound?  This lesson on the Empirical Rule is an extension of the previous lesson . In the prior lesson, the goal was to develop an intuition of the interaction between decreased probability and increased distance from the mean. In this lesson, we will practice applying the Empirical Rule to estimate the specific probability of occurrence of a sample based on the range of the sample, measured in standard deviations.  The graphics below describe the important features of normal distributions. Note how the graph resembles a bell? Now you know why the normal distribution is also called a “bell curve”.    50% of the data is above, and 50% below, the mean of the data  Image Credit: RRCC   Both the right half and the left half of the bell curve are labeled as 50%      Approximately 68% of the data occurs within 1 SD of the mean  Image Credit: RRCC   The bell curve is divide into four regions with one standard deviation below the mean, the mean, and one standard deviation above the mean. The regions (from left to right) are labeled 16%, 34%, 34%, 16%.      Approximately 95% occurs within 2 SD’s of the mean  Image Credit: RRCC   The bell curve is divide into four regions with two standard deviations below the mean, the mean, and two standard deviations above the mean. The regions (from left to right) are labeled 2.5%, 47.5%, 47.5%, 2.5%.      Approximately 99.7% of the data occurs within 3 SD’s of the mean  Image Credit: RRCC   The bell curve is divide into four regions with three standard deviations below the mean, the mean, and three standard deviations above the mean. The regions (from left to right) are labeled 0.15%, 49.85%, 49.85%, 0.15%.       It is due to the probabilities associated with 1, 2, and 3 SD’s that the Empirical Rule is also known as the “68-95-99.7 rule”. The graphic from is a rather concise summary of the vital statistics of a Normal Distribution.    If the diameter of a basketball is normally distributed, with a mean ( ) of 9\", and a standard deviation ( ) of 0.5\", what is the probability that a randomly chosen basketball will have a diameter between 9.5\" and 10.5\"?   Since in and in, we are evaluating the probability that a randomly chosen ball will have a diameter between 1 and 3 standard deviations above the mean. The graphic below shows the portion of the normal distribution included between 1 and 3 SDs:   Image Credit: RRCC   A bell curve has the region from 9.5 inch to 10 inch labeled as 13.5% and the region from 10 inch to 10.5 inch labeled as 2.35%     The percentage of the data spanning the 2nd and 3rd SDs is 13.5% + 2.35% = 15.85%  The probability that a randomly chosen basketball will have a diameter between 9.5 and 10.5 inches is 0.1585, which means there is a 15.85% chance the basketball will have a diameter between 9.5 and 10.5 inches.     If the depth of the snow in my yard is normally distributed, with inches and inches, what is the probability that a randomly chosen location will have a snow depth between 2.25 and 2.75 inches?   2.25 inches is , and 2.75 inches is , so the area encompassed approximately represents 34% + 34% = 68%.  The probability that a randomly chosen location will have a depth between 2.25 and 2.75 inches is .68.     If the height of women in the U.S. is normally distributed with a mean of 5'8\" and a standard deviation of 1.5\", what is the probability that a randomly chosen woman in the U.S. is shorter than 5'5\"?   This one is slightly different, since we aren’t looking for the probability of a limited range of values. We want to evaluate the probability of a value occurring anywhere below 5'5\". Since the domain of a normal distribution is infinite, we can’t actually state the probability of the portion of the distribution on ‘that end’ because it has no ‘end’! What we need to do is add up the probabilities that we do know and subtract them from 100% to get the remainder.  Here is that normal distribution graphic again, with the height data inserted:   Image Credit: RRCC   A bell curve has the region from 5 ft 5 inch to 5 ft 6.5 inch labeled as 13.5% and the region from 5 ft 6.5 inch to 5 ft 8 inch labeled as 34%. The region above 5 ft 8 inch is labeled as 50%.     Recall that a normal distribution always has 50% of the data on each side of the mean. That indicates that 50% of U.S. females are taller than 5'8\", and gives us a solid starting point to calculate from. There is another 34% between 5'6.5\" and 5'8\" and a final 13.5% between 5'5\" and 5'6.5\". Ultimately that totals: .  Since 87.5% of U.S. females are 5'5\" or taller, that leaves 12.5% that are less than 5'5\" tall.    Returning to the problem we started with:  If the price per pound of USDA Choice Beef is normally distributed with a mean of $4.85\/lb and a standard deviation of $0.35\/lb, what is the estimated probability that a randomly chosen sample (from a randomly chosen market) will be between $5.20 and $5.55 per pound?  $5.20 is , and $5.55 is , so the probability of a value occurring in that range is approximately 0.135. There is a 13.5% chance that a value will occur in that range.  Try It Now  A normally distributed data set has and , what is the probability of randomly selecting a value greater than 17.5 from the set?  . Since we are looking for all data above that point, we can subtract to find the percent of data that is outside of 3 standard deviation from the mean. We are only looking for the data that is above 3 standard deviations, so . There is a 0.15% chance the value will be great than 17.5, or a probability of 0.0015.   Try It Now  A normally distributed data set has and , what is the probability of randomly choosing a value between .05 and .07 from the set?  0.05 is the mean, and 0.07 is 2 standard deviations above the mean, so the chnace of a value in that range is 34% + 13.5% = 47.5%. The probability of a value in that range would be 0.475.   Try It Now A normally distributed data set has a mean of 514 and an unknown standard deviation, what is the probability that a randomly selected value will be less than 514?  514 is the mean, so the probability of a value less than that is 0.5.

  "body": "Z-Scores    Compute z-scores  Use a z-score table to calculate probabilities    Using the Empirical Rule can give you a good idea of the probability of occurrence of a value that happens to be exactly one, two or three to either side of the mean, but how do you compare the probabilities of values that are in between standard deviations?  Z-scores are related to the Empirical Rule from the standpoint of being a method of evaluating how extreme a particular value is in a given set. You can think of a z-score as the number of standard deviations there are between a given value and the mean of the set. While the Empirical Rule allows you to associate the first three standard deviations with the percentage of data that each SD includes, the z-score allows you to state (as accurately as you like), just how many SDs a given value is above or below the mean.  Conceptually, the z-score calculation is just what you might expect, given that you are calculating the number of SDs between a value and the mean. You calculate the z-score by first calculating the difference between your value and the mean, and then dividing that amount by the standard deviation of the set. The formula looks like this:   where is the z-score corresponding to a data value ( ) in a normal distribution with a mean of and a standard deviation of .  In this lesson, we will practice calculating the z-score for various values. In the next lesson, we will learn how to associate the z-score of a value with the probability that the value will occur.   What is the z-score of a value of 27, given a set mean of 24, and a standard deviation of 2?   To find the z-score we need to divide the difference between the value, 27, and the mean, 24, by the standard deviation of the set, 2.   The z-score of 27 is . This indicates that 27 is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.     What is the z-score of a value of , in a set with and ?   Find the difference between the given value and the mean, then divide it by the standard deviation.   The z-score of 104.5 is . Note that the z-score is negative, since the measured value, , is less than (below) the mean, .     Find the value represented by a z-score of , given and .   This one requires that we solve for a missing value rather than for a missing z-score, so we just need to fill in our formula with what we know and solve for the missing value:    To solve for , we can mutliply both sides by    has a z-score of .    Try It Now  What is the z-score of the price of a pair of skis that cost $247, if the mean ski price is $279, with a standard deviation of $16?    Try It Now  What is the z-score of a 5-scoop ice cream cone if the mean number of scoops is 3, with a standard deviation of 1 scoop?    Try It Now  What is the z-score of the weight of a cow that tips the scales at 825 lbs, if the mean weight for cows of her type is 1150 lbs, with a standard deviation of 77 lbs?    Knowing the z-score of a given value is great, but what can you do with it? How does a z-score relate to probability? What is the probability of occurrence of a z-score less than +2.47?  Since z-scores are a measure of the number of SDs between a value and the mean, they can be used to calculate probability by comparing the location of the z-score to the area under a normal curve either to the left or right. The area can be calculated using calculus, but we will just use a table to look up the area.  In order to find the values for z-scores that aren’t integers, you can use a table like the one below. To find the value associated with a given z-score, you find the first decimal of your z-score on the left or right side and then the 2nd decimal of your z-score across the top or bottom of the table.

This particular table assumes you are looking to find the probability associated with a positive z-score. You may have additional work to do if the z-score is negative.    To find the percentage of values greater than a negative Z score, just look up the matching positive Z score value.  To find the percentage of values less than a negative z-score, subtract the chart value from 1.  To find the percentage of values greater than a positive z-score, subtract the chart value from 1.    What is the probability that a value with a z-score less than 2.47 will occur in a normal distribution?   Scroll up to the table above and find “2.4” on the left or right side. Now move across the table to “0.07” on the top or bottom, and record the value in the cell: . That tells us that 99.32% of values in the set are at or below a z-score of 2.47.     What is the probability that a value with a z-score greater than 1.53 will occur in a normal distribution?   Scroll up to the table of z-score probabilities again and find the intersection between 1.5 on the left or right and 3 on the top or bottom, record the value in the cell: .  That decimal lets us know that 93.7% of values in the set are below the z-score of 1.53. To find the percentage that is above that value, we subtract 0.937 from 1.0 (or 93.7% from 100%), to get 0.063 or 6.3%.    What is the probability of a random selection being less than 3.65, given a normal distribution with and ?   This question requires us to first find the z-score for the value 3.65, then calculate the percentage of values below that z-score.    Find the z-score for 3.65, using the z-score formula:    Now we can scroll up to our z-score reference above and find the intersection of 0.6 and 0.01, which should be .  Since this is a negative z-score, and we want the percentage of values below it, we subtract that decimal from 1.0 (reference the three steps highlighted by bullet points below the chart if you didn’t recall this), to get   There is approximately a 27.09% chance that a value less than 3.65 would occur from a random selection of a normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 2.2.    Returning to the problem,  Knowing the z-score of a given value is great, but what can you do with it? How does a z-score relate to probability? What is the probability of occurrence of a z-score less than 2.47?  A z-score lets you calculate the probability that a randomly selected value will be greater or less than a particular value in a set.  To find the probability of a z-score below +2.47, using a reference such as the table in the lesson above:    Find 2.4 on the left or right side  Move across to 0.07 on the top or bottom.  The cell you arrive at says: , which means that apx 99.32% of the values in a normal distribution will occur below a z-score of 2.47.   Try It Now  What is the probability of occurrence of a value with z-score greater than 1.24?  Since this is a positive z-score, we can use the value for z = 1.24 directly from the table: 0.8925   Try It Now  What percent of the data in a normal distribution has z-score below ?  This is a negative z-score, and we want the percentage of values greater than it, so we need to subtract the value for z = +0.23 from 1: . 40.9% percent of the data in a normal distribution have z-scores less than -0.23.   Do z-score probabilities always need to be calculated as the chance of a value either above or below a given score? How would you calculate the probability of a z-score between two values?  To calculate the probability of getting a value with a z-score between two other z-scores, you can use a reference table (such as ) to look up the value for both scores and subtract them to find the difference.  What is the probability associated with a z-score between 1.2 and 2.31?   To evaluate the probability of a value occurring within a given range, you need to find the probability of both the upper and lower values in the range, and subtract to find the difference.   Image Credit: RRCC   A bell curve with the region below z=1.2 is labeled as 88.49% and the region below z=2.31 is labeled as 98.96%.     First find z = 1.2 on the z-score probability reference above: . Remember that value represents the percentage of values below 1.2.  Next, find and record the value associated with z = 2.31:  Since approximately 88.49% of all values are below z = 1.2 and approximately 98.96% of all values are below z = 2.31, there are 98.96% -88.49% = 10.47% of values between.    What is the probability that a random selection will be between 8.45 and 10.25, if it is from a normal distribution with and ?   This question requires us to first find the z-scores for the value 8.45 and 10.25, then calculate the percentage of value between them by using values from a z-score reference and finding the difference.    Find the z-score for 8.45, using the z-score formula:   Find the z-score for 10.25 the same way:   Now find the percentages for each, using a reference (don’t forget we want the probability of values less than our negative score and less than our positive score, so we can find the values between):     At this point, let’s sketch the graph to get an idea what we are looking for:   Image Credit: RRCC   A bell curve with the region below z=0.13 is labeled as 55.17% and the region below z=-0.78 is labeled as 21.77%%.      Finally, subtract the values to find the difference:  or about 33.4%  There is approximately a 33.4% chance (or 0.334 probability) that a value between 8.45 and 10.25 would result from a random selection of a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2.      Try It Now  What is the probability of a z-score between -0.93 and 2.11?   Using the z-score probability table above, we can see that the probability of a value below -0.93 is .1762, and the probability of a value below 2.11 is .9826. Therefore, the probability of a value between them is .9826-.1762 = .8064    Try It Now  What is P(1.39 < Z < 2.03)?  Using the z-score probability table, we see that the probability of a value below z = 1.39 is .9177, and a value below z = 2.03 is .9788. That means that the probability of a value between them is .9788 - .9177 = .0611.   "

  "title": "The Plurality Method",
  "body": "The Plurality Method    Find the winner of an election using the plurality method  Determine if an election has a Condorcet candidate  Understand whether an election has violated the Condorcet criterion    The voting method we’re most familiar with in the United States is the plurality method.  Plurality  Plurality Method  In this method, the choice with the most first-preference votes is declared the winner. Ties are possible, and would have to be settled through some sort of run-off vote.   This method is sometimes mistakenly called the majority method, or “majority rules”, but it is not necessary for a choice to have gained a majority of votes to win. A majority is over 50%; it is possible for a winner to have a plurality without having a majority.   In our election from previous pages, we had the preference table:      1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     Who wins the election with the plurality method?   For the plurality method, we only care about the first choice options. Totaling them up:  Anaheim: first-choice votes  Orlando: first-choice votes  Hawaii: first-choice votes  Anaheim is the winner using the plurality voting method.  Notice that Anaheim won with 4 out of 10 votes, 40% of the votes, which is a plurality of the votes, but not a majority.    Try It Now  Three candidates are running in an election for County Executive: Goings (G), McCarthy (M), and Bunney (B). The voting schedule is shown below. Which candidate wins under the plurality method?      14  44  20  70  22  80  39    1st choice  G  G  G  M  M  B  B    2nd choice  M  B   G  B  M     3rd choice  B  M   B  G  G      Note: In the third column and last column, those voters only recorded a first-place vote, so we don’t know who their second and third choices would have been.  Using plurality method:  G gets first-choice votes  M gets first-choice votes  B gets first-choice votes  Bunney (B) wins under plurality method.     What's Wrong with Plurality?  The election from may seem totally clean, but there is a problem lurking that arises whenever there are three or more choices. Looking back at our preference table, how would our members vote if they only had two choices?  Anaheim vs Orlando: 7 out of the 10 would prefer Anaheim over Orlando      1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     Anaheim vs Hawaii: 6 out of 10 would prefer Hawaii over Anaheim      1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     This doesn’t seem right, does it? Anaheim just won the election, yet 6 out of 10 voters, 60% of them, would have preferred Hawaii! That hardly seems fair. Marquis de Condorcet, a French philosopher, mathematician, and political scientist wrote about how this could happen in 1785, and for him we name our first fairness criterion.  Fairness Criteria  The fairness criteria are statements that seem like they should be true in a fair election.   Condorcet Criterion  If there is a choice that is preferred in every one-to-one comparison with the other choices, that choice should be the winner. We call this winner the Condorcet Winner, or Condorcet Candidate .    In the election in is there a Condorcet candidate? If so, who?   We see above that Hawaii is preferred over Anaheim (6 out of 10 people prefer Hawaii to Anaheim). Comparing Hawaii to Orlando, we can that 6 out of 10 people ranked Hawaii abover Orlando.  Since Hawaii is preferred in a one-to-one comparison to both other choices, Hawaii is the Condorcet Winner.     Consider a city council election in a district that is historically 60% Democratic voters and 40% Republican voters. Even though city council is technically a nonpartisan office, people generally know the affiliations of the candidates. In this election there are three candidates: Don and Key, both Democrats, and Elle, a Republican. A preference schedule for the votes looks as follows:      342  214  298    1st choice  Elle  Don  Key    2nd choice  Don  Key  Don    3rd choice  Key  Elle  Elle     We can see a total of voters participated in this election. Computing percentage of first place votes:    Don:  Key:  Elle:    So in this election, the Democratic voters split their vote over the two Democratic candidates, allowing the Republican candidate Elle to win under the plurality method with 40% of the vote.  Analyzing this election closer, we see that it violates the Condorcet Criterion. Analyzing the one-to-one comparisons:    Elle vs Don: 342 prefer Elle; 512 prefer Don: Don is preferred  Elle vs Key: 342 prefer Elle; 512 prefer Key: Key is preferred  Don vs Key: 556 prefer Don; 298 prefer Key: Don is preferred   So even though Don had the smallest number of first-place votes in the election, he is the Condorcet winner, being preferred in every one-to-one comparison with the other candidates.   Try It Now  Consider the election in the preference schedule below. Is there a Condorcet winner in this election?      14  44  20  70  22  80  39    1st choice  G  G  G  M  M  B  B    2nd choice  M  B   G  B  M     3rd choice  B  M   B  G  G       Determining the Condorcet Winner:    G vs M: prefer G, prefer M: M preferred  G vs B: prefer G, prefer B: G preferred  M vs B: prefer M, prefer B: M preferred   M is preferred over both B and G, so M is the Condorcet winner, based on the information we have.     Insincere Voting  Situations like the one in above, when there are more than one candidate that share somewhat similar points of view, can lead to insincere voting. Insincere voting is when a person casts a ballot counter to their actual preference for strategic purposes. In the case above, the democratic leadership might realize that Don and Key will split the vote, and encourage voters to vote for Key by officially endorsing him. Not wanting to see their party lose the election, as happened in the scenario above, Don’s supporters might insincerely vote for Key, effectively voting against Elle.   "

  "body": " Instant Runoff Voting    Find the winner of an election using the instant runoff voting  Understand whether an election has violated the monotonicity criterion    Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), also called Plurality with Elimination, is a modification of the plurality method that attempts to address the issue of insincere voting.  Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)  In IRV, voting is done with preference ballots, and a preference schedule is generated. The choice with the least first-place votes is then eliminated from the election, and any votes for that candidate are redistributed to the voters’ next choice. This continues until a choice has a majority (over 50%).  This is similar to the idea of holding runoff elections, but since every voter’s order of preference is recorded on the ballot, the runoff can be computed without requiring a second costly election.  This voting method is used in several political elections around the world, including election of members of the Australian House of Representatives, and was used for county positions in Pierce County, Washington until it was eliminated by voters in 2009. A version of IRV is used by the International Olympic Committee to select host nations.   Consider the preference schedule below, in which a company’s advertising team is voting on five different advertising slogans, called A, B, C, D, and E here for simplicity.      3  4  4  6  2  1    1st Choice  B  C  B  D  B  E    2nd Choice  C  A  D  C  E  A    3rd Choice  A  D  C  A  A  D    4th Choice  D  B  A  E  C  B    5th Choice  E  E  E  B  D  C     If this was a plurality election, note that B would be the winner with 9 first-choice votes, compared to 6 for D, 4 for C, and 1 for E.  There are total of votes. A majority would be votes. No one yet has a majority, so we proceed to elimination rounds.  Round 1: We make our first elimination. Choice A has the fewest first-place votes, so we remove that choice.       3  4  4  6  2  1    1st Choice  B  C  B  D  B  E    2nd Choice  C    D  C  E      3rd Choice    D  C      D    4th Choice  D  B    E  C  B    5th Choice  E  E  E  B  D  C     We then shift everyone’s choices up to fill the gaps. There is still no choice with a majority, so we eliminate again.       3  4  4  6  2  1    1st Choice  B  C  B  D  B  E    2nd Choice  C  D  D  C  E  D    3rd Choice  D  B  C  E  C  B    4th Choice  E  E  E  B  D  C     Round 2: We make our second elimination. Choice E has the fewest first-place votes, so we remove that choice, shifting everyone’s options to fill the gaps.       3  4  4  6  2  1    1st Choice  B  C  B  D  B  D    2nd Choice  C  D  D  C  C  B    3rd Choice  D  B  C  B  D  C     Notice that the first and fifth columns have the same preferences now, we can condense those down to one column.       5  4  4  6  1    1st Choice  B  C  B  D  D    2nd Choice  C  D  D  C  B    3rd Choice  D  B  C  B  C     Now B has 9 first-choice votes, C has 4 votes, and D has 7 votes. Still no majority, so we eliminate again.  Round 3: We make our third elimination. C has the fewest votes.       3  4  4  6  2  1    1st Choice  B  D  B  D  B  D    2nd Choice  D  B  D  B  D  B     Condensing this down:      9  11    1st Choice  B  D    2nd Choice  D  B     D has now gained a majority, and is declared the winner under IRV.   Try It Now  Consider again the election,      14  44  20  70  22  80  39    1st choice  G  G  G  M  M  B  B    2nd choice  M  B   G  B  M     3rd choice  B  M   B  G  G      Find the winner using IRV.  G has the fewest first-choice votes, so is eliminated first. The 20 voters who did not list a second choice do not get transferred - they simply get eliminated.      136  133    1st Choice  M  B    2nd Choice  B  M     McCarthy (M) now has a majority, and is declared the winner.     What's Wrong with IRV?   Let’s return to our City Council Election. Who wins using the IRV method?      342  214  298    1st Choice  Elle  Don  Key    2nd Choice  Don  Key  Don    3rd Choice  Key  Elle  Elle      In this election, Don has the smallest number of first place votes, so Don is eliminated in the first round. The 214 people who voted for Don have their votes transferred to their second choice, Key.      342  512    1st Choice  Elle  Key    2nd Choice  Key  Elle     So Key is the winner under the IRV method.  We can immediately notice that in this election, IRV violates the Condorcet Criterion, since we determined earlier that Don was the Condorcet winner. On the other hand, the temptation has been removed for Don’s supporters to vote for Key; they now know their vote will be transferred to Key, not simply discarded.     Consider the voting system below.      37  22  12  29    1st Choice  Adams  Brown  Brown  Carter    2nd Choice  Brown  Carter  Adams  Adams    3rd Choice  Carter  Adams  Carter  Brown     In this election, Carter would be eliminated in the first round, and Adams would be the winner with 66 votes to 34 for Brown.  Now suppose that the results were announced, but election officials accidentally destroyed the ballots before they could be certified, and the votes had to be recast. Wanting to “jump on the bandwagon”, 10 of the voters who had originally voted in the order Brown, Adams, Carter change their vote to favor the presumed winner, changing those votes to Adams, Brown, Carter.      47  22  2  29    1st Choice  Adams  Brown  Brown  Carter    2nd Choice  Brown  Carter  Adams  Adams    3rd Choice  Carter  Adams  Carter  Brown     In this re-vote, Brown will be eliminated in the first round, having the fewest first-place votes. After transferring votes, we find that Carter will win this election with 51 votes to Adams’ 49 votes! Even though the only vote changes made favored Adams, the change ended up costing Adams the election. This doesn’t seem right, and introduces our second fairness criterion.   Monotonicity Criterion  If voters change their votes to increase the preference for a candidate, it should not harm that candidate’s chances of winning.   This criterion is violated by the election in the previous example. Note that even though the criterion is violated in this particular election, it does not mean that IRV always violates the criterion; just that IRV has the potential to violate the criterion in certain elections.

Borda Count  Borda Count  In this method, points are assigned to candidates based on their ranking; 1 point for last choice, 2 points for second-to-last choice, and so on. The point values for all ballots are totaled, and the candidate with the largest point total is the winner.    A group of mathematicians are getting together for a conference. The members are coming from four cities: Seattle, Tacoma, Puyallup, and Olympia.  The votes for where to hold the conference were:      51  25  10  14    1st Choice  Seattle  Tacoma  Puyallup  Olympia    2nd Choice  Tacoma  Puyallup  Tacoma  Tacoma    3rd Choice  Olympia  Olympia  Olympia  Puyallup    4th Choice  Puyallup  Seattle  Seattle  Seattle     Which city will be selected with the Borda count method?   In each of the 51 ballots ranking Seattle first, Puyallup will be given 1 point, Olympia 2 points, Tacoma 3 points, and Seattle 4 points. Multiplying the points per vote times the number of votes allows us to calculate points awarded:  Seattle: points  Tacoma: points  Puyallup: points  Olympia: points  Under the Borda Count method, Tacoma is the winner of this vote.    Try It Now  Consider again the election described by the preference schedule. Who will win using the Borda count method?      14  10  8  4  1    1st Choice  Alan  Caroline  Dawn  Boris  Caroline    2nd Choice  Boris  Boris  Caroline  Dawn  Dawn    3rd Choice  Caroline  Dawn  Boris  Caroline  Boris    4th Choice  Dawn  Alan  Alan  Alan  Alan      A gets points  B gets points  C gets points  D gets points  So the winner is Boris (B).     What's Wrong with Borda Count  You might have already noticed one potential flaw of the Borda Count from the previous example. In that example, Seattle had a majority of first-choice votes, yet lost the election! This seems odd, and prompts our next fairness criterion:  Majority Criterion  If a choice has a majority of first-place votes, that choice should be the winner.   The election from using the Borda Count violates the Majority Criterion. Notice also that this automatically means that the Condorcet Criterion will also be violated, as Seattle would have been preferred by 51% of voters in any head-to-head comparison.  Borda count is sometimes described as a consensus-based voting system, since it can sometimes choose a more broadly acceptable option over the one with majority support. In the example above, Tacoma is probably the best compromise location. This is a different approach than plurality and instant runoff voting that focus on first-choice votes; Borda Count considers every voter’s entire ranking to determine the outcome.  Because of this consensus behavior, Borda Count, or some variation of it, is commonly used in awarding sports awards. Variations are used to determine the Most Valuable Player in baseball, to rank teams in NCAA sports, and to award the Heisman trophy.   "

  "body": "Copeland's Method    Find the winner of an election using Copeland's method  Understand whether an election has violated the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion    So far none of our voting methods have satisfied the Condorcet Criterion. The Copeland Method specifically attempts to satisfy the Condorcet Criterion by looking at pairwise (one-to-one) comparisons.  Copeland's Method  Copeland’s Method  In this method, each pair of candidates is compared, using all preferences to determine which of the two is more preferred. The more preferred candidate is awarded 1 point. If there is a tie, each candidate is awarded point. After all pairwise comparisons are made, the candidate with the most points, and hence the most pairwise wins, is declared the winner.   Variations of Copeland’s Method are used in many professional organizations, including election of the Board of Trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia.   Consider our vacation group example from the beginning of the chapter. Determine the winner using Copeland’s Method.      1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O      We need to look at each pair of choices, and see which choice would win in a one-to-one comparison.  Hawaii vs Orlando  Hawaii vs Anaheim  Anaheim vs Orlando    You may recall we did this earlier when determining the Condorcet Winner. For example, comparing Hawaii vs Orlando, we see that 6 voters, those shaded below in the first table below, would prefer Hawaii to Orlando. Note that Hawaii doesn’t have to be the voter’s first choice - we’re imagining that Anaheim wasn’t an option. If it helps, you can imagine removing Anaheim, as in the table below.      1  3  3  3    1st choice    O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H     3rd choice  H  O   O     Based on this, in the comparison of Hawaii vs Orlando, Hawaii wins, and receives 1 point.  Comparing Anaheim to Orlando, the 1 voter in the first column clearly prefers Anaheim, as do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column clearly prefer Orlando. The 3 voters in the last column prefer Hawaii as their first choice, but if they had to choose between Anaheim and Orlando, they'd choose Anaheim, their second choice overall. So, altogether 1+3+3=7 voters prefer Anaheim over Orlando, and 3 prefer Orlando over Anaheim. So, comparing Anaheim vs Orlando: 7 votes to 3 votes: Anaheim gets 1 point.  To sumarize:  Hawaii vs Orlando: 6 votes to 4 votes: Hawaii gets 1 point  Anaheim vs Orlando: 7 votes to 3 votes: Anaheim gets 1 point  Hawaii vs Anaheim: 6 votes to 4 votes: Hawaii gets 1 point  Hawaii is the winner under Copeland’s Method, having earned the most points.  Notice this process is consistent with our determination of a Condorcet Winner.     Consider the advertising group’s vote we explored earlier. Determine the winner using Copeland’s method.      3  4  4  6  2  1    1st Choice  B  C  B  D  B  E    2nd Choice  C  A  D  C  E  A    3rd Choice  A  D  C  A  A  D    4th Choice  D  B  A  E  C  B    5th Choice  E  E  E  B  D  C      With 5 candidates, there are 10 comparisons to make:  A vs B: 11 votes to 9 votes: A gets 1 pt  A vs C: 3 votes to 17 votes: C gets 1 pt  A vs D: 10 votes to 10 votes: Both A and D get pt  A vs E: 17 votes to 3 votes: A gets 1 pt  B vs C: 10 votes to 10 votes: Both B and C get pt  B vs D: 9 votes to 11 votes: D gets 1 pt  B vs E: 13 votes to 7 votes: B gets 1 pt  C vs D: 9 votes to 11 votes: D gets 1 pt  C vs E: 17 votes to 3 votes: C gets 1 pt  D vs E: 17 votes to 3 votes: D gets 1 pt    Totaling these up:  A = pts  B = pts  C = pts  D = pts  E = pts    Using Copeland’s Method, we declare D as the winner.  Notice that in this case, D is not a Condorcet Winner. While Copeland’s method will also select a Condorcet Candidate as the winner, the method still works in cases where there is no Condorcet Winner.     What's Wrong with Copeland's Method?  As already noted, Copeland’s Method does satisfy the Condorcet Criterion. It also satisfies the Majority Criterion and the Monotonicity Criterion. So is this the perfect method? Well, in a word, no.   A committee is trying to award a scholarship to one of four students, Anna (A), Brian (B), Carlos (C), and Dimitry (D). The votes are shown below:      5  5  6  4    1st Choice  D  A  C  B    2nd Choice  A  C  B  D    3rd Choice  C  B  D  A    4th Choice  B  D  A  C      Making the comparisons:  A vs B: 10 votes to 10 votes: A and B both get pt  A vs C: 14 votes to 6 votes: A gets 1 pt  A vs D: 5 votes to 15 votes: D gets 1 pt  B vs C: 4 votes to 16 votes: C gets 1 pt  B vs D: 15 votes to 5 votes: B gets 1 pt  C vs D: 11 votes to 9 votes: C gets 1 pt   Totaling:  A has pts  B has pts  C has pts  D has pt   So Carlos is awarded the scholarship. However, the committee then discovers that Dimitry was not eligible for the scholarship (he failed his last math class). Even though this seems like it shouldn’t affect the outcome, the committee decides to recount the vote, removing Dimitry from consideration. This reduces the preference schedule to:      5  5  6  4    1st Choice  A  A  C  B    2nd Choice  C  C  B  A    3rd Choice  B  B  A  C       A vs B: 10 votes to 10 votes: Both A and B get pt  A vs C: 14 votes to 6 votes: A gets point  B vs C: 4 votes to 16 votes: C gets point   Totaling:   A has points  C has point  B has point   Suddenly Anna is the winner! This leads us to another fairness criterion.    The Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) Criterion  If a non-winning choice is removed from the ballot, it should not change the winner of the election.  Equivalently, if choice A is preferred over choice B, introducing or removing a choice C should not cause B to be preferred over A.   In the previous example, the IIA Criterion was violated.  This anecdote illustrating the IIA issue is attributed to Sidney Morgenbesser:  After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says \"In that case I'll have the blueberry pie.\"  Another disadvantage of Copeland’s Method is that it is fairly easy for the election to end in a tie. For this reason, Copeland’s method is usually the first part of a more advanced method that uses more sophisticated methods for breaking ties and determining the winner when there is not a Condorcet Candidate.

However, the committee then discovers that Dimitry was not eligible for the scholarship (he failed his last math class). Even though this seems like it shouldn’t affect the outcome, the committee decides to recount the vote, removing Dimitry from consideration. This reduces the preference schedule to:      5  5  6  4    1st Choice  A  A  C  B    2nd Choice  C  C  B  A    3rd Choice  B  B  A  C       A vs B: 10 votes to 10 votes: Both A and B get pt  A vs C: 14 votes to 6 votes: A gets point  B vs C: 4 votes to 16 votes: C gets point   Totaling:   A has points  C has point  B has point   Suddenly Anna is the winner! This leads us to another fairness criterion.   "

  "body": "Where's the Fair Method?    Define Arrow's Impossibility Theorem    At this point, you’re probably asking why we keep looking at method after method just to point out that they are not fully fair. We must be holding out on the perfect method, right?  Unfortunately, no. A mathematical economist, Kenneth Arrow, was able to prove in 1949 that there is no voting method that will satisfy all the fairness criteria we have discussed.  Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem  Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem states, roughly, that it is not possible for a voting method to satisfy every fairness criteria that we’ve discussed.   To see a very simple example of how difficult voting can be, consider the election below:      5  5  5    1st Choice  A  C  B    2nd Choice  B  A  C    3rd Choice  C  B  A     Notice that in this election:  10 people prefer A to B  10 people prefer B to C  10 people prefer C to A   No matter whom we choose as the winner, 2\/3 of voters would prefer someone else! This scenario is dubbed Condorcet’s Voting Paradox, and demonstrates how voting preferences are not transitive (just because A is preferred over B, and B over C, does not mean A is preferred over C). In this election, there is no fair resolution.  It is because of this impossibility of a totally fair method that Plurality, IRV, Borda Count, Copeland’s Method, and dozens of variants are all still used. Usually the decision of which method to use is based on what seems most fair for the situation in which it is being applied.  "

  "body": "Approval Voting  Approval Voting    Find the winner of an election using approval voting    Up until now, we’ve been considering voting methods that require ranking of candidates on a preference ballot. There is another method of voting that can be more appropriate in some decision making scenarios. With Approval Voting, the ballot asks you to mark all choices that you find acceptable. The results are tallied, and the option with the most approval is the winner.   A group of friends is trying to decide upon a movie to watch. Three choices are provided, and each person is asked to mark with an “X” which movies they are willing to watch. The results are:      Bob  Ann  Marv  Alice  Eve  Omar  Lupe  Dave  Tish  Jim    Titantic   X  X    X   X   X    Scream  X   X  X   X  X   X     The Matrix  X  X  X  X  X   X    X      Totaling the results, we find  Titanic received 5 approvals  Scream received 6 approvals  The Matrix received 7 approvals   In this vote, The Matrix would be the winner.    Try It Now  Our mathematicians deciding on a conference location from earlier decide to use Approval voting. Their votes are tallied below. Find the winner using Approval voting.      30  10  15  20  15  5  5    Seattle  X  X  X    X     Tacoma  X   X  X  X  X     Puyallup   X   X  X  X     Olympia    X   X   X      Using Approval voting, Tacoma is the winner:  Seattle has votes  Tacoma has votes  Puyallup has votes  Olympia has votes     What's Wrong wtih Approval Voting?  Approval voting can very easily violate the Majority Criterion.   Consider the voting schedule:      80  15  5    1st Choice  A  B  C    2nd Choice  B  C  B    3rd Choice  C  A  A      Clearly A is the majority winner. Now suppose that this election was held using Approval Voting, and every voter marked approval of their top two candidates.  A would receive approval from 80 voters  B would receive approval from 100 voters  C would receive approval from 20 voters  B would be the winner.    Some argue that Approval Voting tends to vote the least disliked choice, rather than the most liked candidate.  Additionally, Approval Voting is susceptible to strategic insincere voting, in which a voter does not vote their true preference to try to increase the chances of their choice winning. For example, in the movie example above, suppose Bob and Alice would much rather watch Scream. They remove The Matrix from their approval list, resulting in a different result.      Bob  Ann  Marv  Alice  Eve  Omar  Lupe  Dave  Tish  Jim    Titantic   X  X    X   X   X    Scream  X   X  X   X  X   X     The Matrix   X  X   X   X    X     Totaling the results, we find Titanic received 5 approvals, Scream received 6 approvals, and The Matrix received 5 approvals. By voting insincerely, Bob and Alice were able to sway the result in favor of their preference.   "

  "body": "Hamilton's Method    Apply Hamilton's method to apportionment problems.  Discover the quota rule.  Understand paradoxes that can occur in apportionment problems.    Alexander Hamilton proposed the method that now bears his name. His method was approved by Congress in 1791, but was vetoed by President Washington. It was later adopted in 1852 and used through 1911. He begins by determining, to several decimal places, how many things each group should get. Since he was interested in the question of Congressional representation, we’ll use the language of states and representatives, so he determines how many representatives each state should get.  Hamilton’s Method  Hamilton's method follows the steps:    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .  Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota . Since we can only allocate whole representatives, Hamilton resolves the whole number problem, as follows:  Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don’t forget what the decimals were). These are called the lower quotas . Add up the remaining whole numbers. This answer will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives (and the “or equal to” part happens only in very specific circumstances that are incredibly unlikely to turn up).  Assuming that the total from the previous step was less than the total number of representatives, assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states whose decimal parts of the quota were largest, until the desired total is reached.    Make sure that each state ends up with at least one representative!   Note on rounding: Today we have technological advantages that Hamilton (and the others) couldn’t even have imagined. Take advantage of them, and keep several decimal places.   The state of Delaware has three counties: Kent, New Castle, and Sussex. The Delaware state House of Representatives has 41 members. If Delaware wants to divide this representation along county lines (which is not required, but let’s pretend they do), let’s use Hamilton’s method to apportion them. The populations of the counties are as follows (from the 2010 Census):     County  Population    Kent  162,310    New Castle  538,479    Sussex  197,145    Total  897,934        First, we determine the divisor:  Now we determine each county’s quota by dividing the county’s population by the divisor:    County  Population  Quota    Kent  162,310  7.4111    New Castle  538,479  24.5872    Sussex  197,145  9.0017    Total  897,934       Removing the decimal parts of the quotas gives:    County  Population  Quota  Initial    Kent  162,310  7.4111  7    New Castle  538,479  24.5872  24    Sussex  197,145  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40      We need 41 representatives and this only gives 40. The remaining one goes to the county with the largest decimal part, which is New Castle:    County  Population  Quota  Initial  Final    Kent  162,310  7.4111  7  7    New Castle  538,479  24.5872  24  25    Sussex  197,145  9.0017  9  9    Total  897,934   40  41           Use Hamilton’s method to apportion the 75 seats of Rhode Island’s House of Representatives among its five counties.

Hamilton’s method obeys something called the Quota Rule. The Quota Rule isn’t a law of any sort, but just an idea that some people, including Hamilton, think is a good one.  Quota Rule  The Quota Rule says that the final number of representatives a state gets should be within one of that state’s quota. Since we’re dealing with whole numbers for our final answers, that means that each state should either go up to the next whole number above its quota, or down to the next whole number below its quota.   After seeing Hamilton’s method, many people find that it makes sense, it’s not that difficult to use (or, at least, the difficulty comes from the numbers that are involved and the amount of computation that’s needed, not from the method), and they wonder why anyone would want another method. The problem is that Hamilton’s method is subject to several paradoxes. Three of them happened, on separate occasions, when Hamilton’s method was used to apportion the United States House of Representatives.  The Alabama Paradox is named for an incident that happened during the apportionment that took place after the 1880 census. (A similar incident happened ten years earlier involving the state of Rhode Island, but the paradox is named after Alabama.) The post-1880 apportionment had been completed, using Hamilton’s method and the new population numbers from the census. Then it was decided that because of the country’s growing population, the House of Representatives should be made larger. That meant that the apportionment would need to be done again, still using Hamilton’s method and the same 1880 census numbers, but with more representatives. The assumption was that some states would gain another representative and others would stay with the same number they already had (since there weren’t enough new representatives being added to give one more to every state). The paradox is that Alabama ended up losing a representative in the process, even though no populations were changed and the total number of representatives increased.  The New States Paradox happened when Oklahoma became a state in 1907. Oklahoma had enough population to qualify for five representatives in Congress. Those five representatives would need to come from somewhere, though, so five states, presumably, would lose one representative each. That happened, but another thing also happened: Maine gained a representative (from New York).  The Population Paradox happened between the apportionments after the census of 1900 and of 1910. In those ten years, Virginia’s population grew at an average annual rate of 1.07%, while Maine’s grew at an average annual rate of 0.67%. Virginia started with more people, grew at a faster rate, grew by more people, and ended up with more people than Maine. By itself, that doesn’t mean that Virginia should gain representatives or Maine shouldn’t, because there are lots of other states involved. But Virginia ended up losing a representative to Maine.  "

  "body": "Jefferson's Method    Apply Jefferson's method to apportionment problems.    Thomas Jefferson proposed a different method for apportionment. After Washington vetoed Hamilton’s method, Jefferson’s method was adopted, and used in Congress from 1791 through 1842. Jefferson, of course, had political reasons for wanting his method to be used rather than Hamilton’s. Primarily, his method favors larger states, and his own home state of Virginia was the largest in the country at the time. He would also argue that it’s the ratio of people to representatives that is the critical thing, and apportionment methods should be based on that. But the paradoxes we saw also provide mathematical reasons for concluding that Hamilton’s method isn’t so good, and while Jefferson’s method might or might not be the best one to replace it, at least we should look for other possibilities.  The first steps of Jefferson’s method are the same as Hamilton’s method. He finds the same divisor and the same quota, and cuts off the decimal parts in the same way, giving a total number of representatives that is less than the required total. The difference is in how Jefferson resolves that difference. He says that since we ended up with an answer that is too small, our divisor must have been too big. He changes the divisor by making it smaller, finding new quotas with the new divisor, cutting off the decimal parts, and looking at the new total, until we find a divisor that produces the required total.  Jefferson’s Method    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the standard divisor .  Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .  Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don’t forget what the decimals were). These are the lower quotas . Add up the remaining whole numbers. This answer will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives.  If the total from the previous step was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the modified divisor or adjusted divisor .      We’ll return to Delaware and apply Jefferson’s method. We begin, as we did with Hamilton’s method, by finding the quotas with the original divisor,     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Kent  162,310  7.4111  7    New Castle  538,479  24.5872  24    Sussex  197,145  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40      We need 41 representatives, and this divisor gives only 40. We must reduce the divisor until we get 41 representatives. Let’s try as the divisor:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Kent  162,310  7.5493  7    New Castle  538,479  25.0455  25    Sussex  197,145  9.1695  9    Total  897,934   41     This gives us the required 41 representatives, so we’re done. If we had fewer than 41, we’d need to reduce the divisor more. If we had more than 41, we’d need to choose a divisor less than the original but greater than the second choice.  Notice that with the new, lower divisor, the quota for New Castle County (the largest county in the state) increased by much more than those of Kent County or Sussex County.     We’ll apply Jefferson’s method for Rhode Island. The original divisor of gave these results:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Bristol  49,875  3.5538  3    Kent  166,158  11.8395  11    Newport  82,888  5.9061  5    Providence  626,667  44.6528  44    Washington  126,979  9.0478  9    Total  1,052,567   72      We need 75 representatives and we only have 72, so we need to use a smaller divisor.

Notice, in comparison to Hamilton’s method, that although the results were the same, they came about in a different way, and the outcome was almost different. Providence County (the largest) almost went up to 46 representatives before Kent (which is much smaller) got to 12. Although that didn’t happen here, it can. Divisor-adjusting methods like Jefferson’s are not guaranteed to follow the quota rule!  "

It was adopted by Congress in 1842, but replaced by Hamilton’s method in 1852. It was then adopted again in 1901. The difference is that Webster rounds the quotas to the nearest whole number rather than dropping the decimal parts. If that doesn’t produce the desired results at the beginning, he says, like Jefferson, to adjust the divisor until it does. (In Jefferson’s case, at least the first adjustment will always be to make the divisor smaller. That is not always the case with Webster’s method.)  Webster’s Method    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives.

Like Jefferson’s method, Webster’s method carries a bias in favor of states with large populations, but rounding the quotas to the nearest whole number greatly reduces this bias. (Notice that Providence County, the largest, is the one that gets a representative trimmed because of the increased quota.) Also like Jefferson’s method, Webster’s method does not always follow the quota rule, but it follows the quota rule much more often than Jefferson’s method does. (In fact, if Webster’s method had been applied to every apportionment of Congress in all of American history, it would have followed the quota rule every single time.)  In 1980, two mathematicians, Peyton Young and Mike Balinski, proved what we now call the Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem.  Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem  The Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem shows that any apportionment method which always follows the quota rule will be subject to the possibility of paradoxes like the Alabama, New States, or Population paradoxes. In other words, we can choose a method that avoids those paradoxes, but only if we are willing to give up the guarantee of following the quota rule.   "

They appointed a committee of mathematicians to investigate, and they recommended the Huntington-Hill Method. They continued to use Webster’s method in 1931, but after a second report recommending Huntington-Hill, it was adopted in 1941 and is the current method of apportionment used in Congress.  The Huntington-Hill Method is similar to Webster’s method, but attempts to minimize the percent differences of how many people each representative will represent.   The population of state A is 5.9 million and they have 7 representatives in Congress. State B has a population of 3.8 million and 5 representatives in Congress. Find the average constituency of each state. Which state is more poorly represented?   The average constituency gives the average number of people each member of Congress represents. We can take the population and divide it by the number of representatives to find the average constituency.    Since the average constituency in state A is larger than state B, state A is more poorly represented. The representatives in state A represent more people than in state B.    We can discuss how average constituencies are different by computing their absolute difference (this is called the absolute unfairness) or relative difference (this is called the relative unfairness).   Absolute and Relative Unfairness  The average constituency is the population divided by the number of representatives.   The Absolute Unfairness of an apportionment is the difference in average constituencies.   The Relative Unfairness of an apportionment is the percent change in constituencies.     The population of state A is 5.9 million and they have 7 representatives in Congress. State B has a population of 3.8 million and 5 representatives in Congress. Find the absolute and relative unfairness of this apportionment.   First, find the average constituency of each state.    The difference in these values is the absolute unfairness. Absolute unfairness should be a positive number, so take the absolute value of the difference if necessary.    The absolute unfairness is people. The relative unfairness is .    The Huntington-Hill method minimizes the relative unfairness of the apportionment.  Huntington-Hill Method    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the standard divisor .  Divide each state’s population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .  Cut off the decimal part of the quota to obtain the lower quota, which we’ll call . Compute , which is the geometric mean of the lower quota and one value higher.  If the quota is larger than the geometric mean, round up the quota; if the quota is smaller than the geometric mean, round down the quota. Add up the resulting whole numbers to get the initial allocation.  If the total from the previous step was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from the previous step was larger than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total in the previous step is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the modified divisor or adjusted divisor .      Again, Delaware, with an initial divisor of . Apportion the 41 seats using the Huntington-Hill method.

In both these cases, the apportionment produced by the Huntington-Hill method was the same as those from Webster’s method.   Consider a small country with 5 states, two of which are much larger than the others. We need to apportion 70 representatives. We will apportion using both Webster’s method and the Huntington-Hill method.     State  Population    A  300,500    B  200,000    C  50,000    D  38,000    E  21,500      The total population is 610,000. Dividing this by the 70 representatives gives the divisor: .  Dividing each state’s population by the divisor gives the quotas.     State  Population  Quota    A  300,500  34.48361    B  200,000  22.95082    C  50,000  5.737705    D  38,000  4.360656    E  21,500  2.467213     Using Webster’s method , we round each quota to the nearest whole number.     State  Population  Quota  Initial    A  300,500  34.48361  34    B  200,000  22.95082  23    C  50,000  5.737705  6    D  38,000  4.360656  4    E  21,500  2.467213  2     Adding these up, they only total 69 representatives, so we adjust the divisor down. Adjusting the divisor down to 8700 gives an updated allocation totaling 70 representatives:     State  Population  Quota  Initial    A  300,500  34.54023  35    B  200,000  22.98851  23    C  50,000  5.747126  6    D  38,000  4.367816  4    E  21,500  2.471264  2     Using the Huntington-Hill method , we round down to find the lower quota, then calculate the geometric mean based on each lower quota. If the quota is less than the geometric mean, we round down; if the quota is more than the geometric mean, we round up.     State  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geom Mean  Initial    A  300,500  34.48361  34   34    B  200,000  22.95082  22   23    C  50,000  5.737705  5   6    D  38,000  4.360656  4   4    E  21,500  2.467213  2   3     These allocations add up to 70, so we’re done.  Webster's method gave the following apportionment: A = 35, B = 23, C = 6, D = 4, D = 2  The Huntington-Hill Method gave: A = 34, B = 23, C = 6, D = 4, E = 3  Notice that this allocation is different than that produced by Webster’s method. In this case, state E got the extra seat instead of state A.    "

<div class="para">We can see that 15 people of the 665 surveyed had both a red car and got a speeding ticket, so the probability is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{15}{665} \approx 0.0226\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Notice that having a red car and getting a speeding ticket are not independent events, so the probability of both of them occurring is not simply the product of probabilities of each one occurring.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">We could answer this question by simply adding up the numbers: 15 people with red cars and speeding tickets + 135 with red cars but no ticket + 45 with a ticket but no red car = 195 people. So the probability is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{195}{665} \approx 0.2932\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">We also could have found this probability by:</div>
<div class="para">P(had a red car) + P(got a speeding ticket) - P(had a red car and got a speeding ticket)=<span class="process-math">\(\frac{150}{665}+\frac{60}{665}-\frac{15}{665}=\frac{195}{665}\text{.}\)</span>

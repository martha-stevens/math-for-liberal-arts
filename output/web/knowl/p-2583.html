<div class="para">Situations like the one in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-voting-insincere.html" title="Example 11.2.11">Example 11.2.11</a> above, when there are more than one candidate that share somewhat similar points of view, can lead to insincere voting. Insincere voting is when a person casts a ballot counter to their actual preference for strategic purposes. In the case above, the democratic leadership might realize that Don and Key will split the vote, and encourage voters to vote for Key by officially endorsing him. Not wanting to see their party lose the election, as happened in the scenario above, Don’s supporters might insincerely vote for Key, effectively voting against Elle.</div>

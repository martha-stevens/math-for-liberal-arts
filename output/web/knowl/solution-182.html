<div class="para">This one is slightly different, since we aren’t looking for the probability of a limited range of values. We want to evaluate the probability of a value occurring anywhere below 5'5". Since the domain of a normal distribution is infinite, we can’t actually state the probability of the portion of the distribution on ‘that end’ because it has no ‘end’! What we need to do is add up the probabilities that we do know and subtract them from 100% to get the remainder.</div> <div class="para">Here is that normal distribution graphic again, with the height data inserted:</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/normal-image-3.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="A bell curve has the region from 5 ft 5 inch to 5 ft 6.5 inch labeled as 13.5% and the region from 5 ft 6.5 inch to 5 ft  8 inch labeled as 34%. The region above 5 ft 8 inch is labeled as 50%."></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">10.2.9<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Image Credit: RRCC</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">Recall that a normal distribution always has 50% of the data on each side of the mean. That indicates that 50% of U.S. females are taller than 5'8", and gives us a solid starting point to calculate from. There is another 34% between 5'6.5" and 5'8" and a final 13.5% between 5'5" and 5'6.5". Ultimately that totals: <span class="process-math">\(50\%+34\%+13.5\%=87.5\%\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Since 87.5% of U.S. females are 5'5" or taller, that leaves 12.5% that are less than 5'5" tall.</div>

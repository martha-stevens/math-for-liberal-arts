        <introduction>
            <p>Once we have collected data from surveys or experiments, we need to summarize and present the data in a way 
                that will be meaningful to the reader. We will begin with graphical presentations of data then explore 
                numerical summaries of data.</p>

        <p>Categorical, or qualitative, data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the objects under 
            investigation into various categories. We usually begin working with categorical data by summarizing the data 
            into a frequency table.</p>

        <definition><title>Frequency Table</title>
            <p>A frequency table is a table with two columns. One column lists the categories, and another for the 
                frequencies with which the items in the categories occur (how many items fit into each category).</p>
        </definition>
        
        <example>
            <p>An insurance company determines vehicle insurance premiums based on known risk factors. If a person is 
                considered a higher risk, their premiums will be higher. One potential factor is the color of your car. The 
                insurance company believes that people with some color cars are more likely to get in accidents. To research 
                this, they examine police reports for recent total-loss collisions. The data is summarized in the frequency 
                table below.</p>

        <p>Sometimes we need an even more intuitive way of displaying data. This is where charts and graphs come in. There 
            are many, many ways of displaying data graphically, but we will concentrate on one very useful type of graph 
            called a bar graph. In this section we will work with bar graphs that display categorical data; the next section 
            will be devoted to bar graphs that display quantitative data.</p>

        <definition><title>Bar graph</title>A bar graph is a graph that displays a bar for each category with the length of 
            each bar indicating the frequency of that category.
        </definition>

        <p>To construct a bar graph, we need to draw a vertical axis and a horizontal axis. The vertical direction will have 
            a scale and measure the frequency of each category; the horizontal axis has no scale in this instance. The 
            construction of a bar chart is most easily described by use of an example.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Using our car data from above, note the highest frequency is 52, so our vertical axis needs to go from 0 to 
                52, but we might as well use 0 to 55, so that we can put a hash mark every 5 units:</p>

            <p>Notice that the height of each bar is determined by the frequency of the corresponding color. The horizontal 
                gridlines are a nice touch, but not necessary. In practice, you will find it useful to draw bar graphs using 
                graph paper, so the gridlines will already be in place, or using technology. Instead of gridlines, we might 
                also list the frequencies at the top of each bar, like this:</p>

        <p>In this case, our chart might benefit from being reordered from largest to smallest frequency values. This 
            arrangement can make it easier to compare similar values in the chart, even without gridlines. When we arrange 
            the categories in decreasing frequency order like this, it is called a Pareto chart.</p>

        <p>To show relative sizes, it is common to use a pie chart.</p>

        <definition><title>Pie Chart</title>
            <p>A pie chart is a circle with wedges cut of varying sizes marked out like slices of pie or pizza. The relative 
                sizes of the wedges correspond to the relative frequencies of the categories.</p>
        </definition>

        <example><p>For our vehicle color data, a pie chart might look like this:</p>
            
            <image width = "50%" source = "images/120_Data_Screenshot1.png">
                <description>A pie chart with six wedges--one corresponding to each color of car from the 
                    previous examples. The size of the wedge corresponds to the relative size of the 
                    frequency.</description>
                
            </image>
            
            <p>Pie charts can often benefit from including frequencies or relative frequencies (percents) in the chart next 
                to the pie slices. Often having the category names next to the pie slices also makes the chart clearer.</p>

                senate seat.</p>

            <p>If there are 20,000 voters in the district, the pie chart shows that about 11% of those, about 2,200 voters, 
                support Reeves.</p>

        <p>Pie charts look nice, but are harder to draw by hand than bar charts since to draw them accurately we would need 
            to compute the angle each wedge cuts out of the circle, then measure the angle with a protractor. Computers are 
            much better suited to drawing pie charts. Common software programs like Microsoft Word or Excel, OpenOffice.org 
            Write or Calc, or Google Docs are able to create bar graphs, pie charts, and other graph types. There are also 
            numerous online tools that can create graphs.</p>

        <p>Here is another way that fanciness can lead to trouble. Instead of plain bars, it is tempting to substitute 
            meaningful images. This type of graph is called a pictogram.</p>
        
        <p>A <term>pictogram</term> is a statistical graphic in which the size of the picture is intended to represent the 
            frequencies or size of the values being represented.</p>

        <example>

            <p>A labor union might produce the graph to show the difference between the average manager salary 
                and the average worker salary.</p>
            <image width = "30%" source = "images/120_Data_Screenshot5.png">
                <description>A large bag of money labeled manager salaries next to a bag of labeled that is half 
                    as tall labeled worker salaries.</description>
            </image>

            <p>Looking at the picture, it would be reasonable to guess that the manager salaries is 4 times as large as the 
                worker salaries - the area of the bag looks about 4 times as large. However, the manager salaries are in 
                fact only twice as large as worker salaries, which were reflected in the picture by making the manager bag 
                twice as tall.</p>
            
        </example>

        <p>Another distortion in bar charts results from setting the baseline to a value other than zero. The baseline is 
            the bottom of the vertical axis, representing the least number of cases that could have occurred in a category. 
            Normally, this number should be zero.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>Compare the two graphs below showing support for same-sex marriage rights from a poll taken in December 
                2008. The difference in the vertical scale on the first graph suggests a different story than the true 
                differences in percentages; the second graph makes it look like twice as many people oppose marriage rights 
                as support it.</p>
            
            <image source = "images/120_Data_Screenshot6.png">
                <description>The first graph has a bar labeled support that starts at 0 and ends at 45 and a bar 
                    labeled oppose that starts at 0 and ends at 55. The second graph has a bar from support that starts 
                    at 40 and ends at 45, and an oppose bar that starts at 40 and ends at 55.</description>
            </image>
            
        </example>
        
        <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
            <p>A poll was taken asking people if they agreed with the positions of the 4 candidates for a county office. 
                Does the pie chart present a good representation of this data? Explain.</p>
            <image width = "50%" source = "images/120_Data_Screenshot7.png">
                <description>A pie chart with four wedges: Nguyen (42%), McKee (35%), Jones (64%) and Brown (52%).
                </description>
            </image>
            
            <answer>While the pie chart accurately depicts the relative size of the people agreeing with each candidate, the 
                chart is confusing, since usually percents on a pie chart represent the percentage of the pie the slice 
                represents.</answer>
        </problem>
        
        <p>Quantitative, or numerical, data can also be summarized into frequency tables.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>A teacher records scores on a 20-point quiz for the 30 students in his class. The scores are:</p>

            <p>19 20 18 18 17 18 19 17 20 18 20 16 20 15 17</p>
            <p>12 18 19 18 19 17 20 18 16 15 18 20 5 0 0</p>

            <p>These scores could be summarized into a frequency table by grouping like values:</p>

            <p>Using this table, it would be possible to create a standard bar chart from this summary, like we did for

        <p>Unfortunately, not a lot of common software packages can correctly graph a histogram. About the best you can do 
            in Excel or Word is a bar graph with no gap between the bars and spacing added to simulate a numerical 
            horizontal axis.</p>

        <p>If we have a large number of widely varying data values, creating a frequency table that lists every possible 
            value as a category would lead to an exceptionally long frequency table, and probably would not reveal any 
            patterns. For this reason, it is common with quantitative data to group data into class intervals.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Class Intervals</title>
            <p>Class intervals are groupings of the data. In general, we define class intervals so that:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each interval is equal in size. For example, if the first class contains values from 120-129, the second 
                    class should include values from 130-139.</li>
                <li>We have somewhere between 5 and 20 classes, typically, depending upon the number of data we’re working 
                    with.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </definition>
        
        <example>
            <p>Suppose that we have collected weights from 100 male subjects as part of a nutrition study. For our weight 
                data, we have values ranging from a low of 121 pounds to a high of 263 pounds, giving a total span of 
                263-121 = 142. We could create 7 intervals with a width of around 20, 14 intervals with a width of around 
                10, or somewhere in between. Often time we have to experiment with a few possibilities to find something 
                that represents the data well. Let us try using an interval width of 15. We could start at 121, or at 120 
                since it is a nice round number.</p>

        <p>It is often desirable to use a few numbers to summarize a distribution. One important aspect of a distribution is 
            where its center is located. Measures of central tendency are discussed first. A second aspect of a distribution 
            is how spread out it is. In other words, how much the data in the distribution vary from one another. The next 
            section describes measures of variability.</p>
        
        <p>Let's begin by trying to find the most "typical" value of a data set.</p>

        <p>Note that we just used the word "typical" although in many cases you might think of using the word "average." We 
            need to be careful with the word "average" as it means different things to different people in different 
            contexts. One of the most common uses of the word "average" is what mathematicians and statisticians call the 
            arithmetic mean, or just plain old mean for short. "Arithmetic mean" sounds rather fancy, but you have likely 
            calculated a mean many times without realizing it; the mean is what most people think of when they use the word 
            "average".</p>

        <definition><title>Mean</title>
            <p>The mean of a set of data is the sum of the data values divided by the number of values.</p>
        </definition>

        <example>
            <p>Marci’s exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, 94. What is the mean of those values?</p>

            <solution>
                <me>\frac{79+86+82+94}{4} = 85.25</me>
                <p>Typically we round means to one more decimal place than the original data had. In this case, we would 
                    round 85.25 to 85.3.</p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>The number of touchdown (TD) passes thrown by each of the 31 teams in the National Football League in the 
                2000 season are shown below.</p>

            <p>37 33 33 32 29 28 28 23 22 22 22 21 21 21 20</p>

            <p>20 19 19 18 18 18 18 16 15 14 14 14 12 12 9 6</p>

            <solution>
                <p>Adding these values, we get 634 total TDs. Dividing by 31, the number of data values, we get 
                    <m>\frac{634}{31}=20.4516</m>. It would be appropriate to round this to 20.5.</p>

                <p>It would be most correct for us to report that “The mean number of touchdown passes thrown in the NFL 
                    in the 2000 season was 20.5 passes,” but it is not uncommon to see the more casual word “average” used 
                    in place of "mean"</p>

                <p>We could calculate this more easily by noticing that adding 15 to itself six times is the same as

                <me>\frac{15 \cdot 6+20 \cdot 8+25\cdot 11+30\cdot 17+35\cdot 19+40\cdot 20+
                    45\cdot 12+50 \cdot 7}{100}=\frac{3390}{100}=33.9</me>
                
                <p>The mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars ($33,900).</p>

            <p>Extending off the last example, suppose a new family moves into the neighborhood example that has a 
                household income of $5 million ($5000 thousand). What is the mean household income?</p>

                <p>While 83.1 thousand dollars ($83,069) is the correct mean household income, it no longer represents a 
                    “typical” value.</p>
                
            </solution>
        </example>

                <p>Imagine the data values on a see-saw or balance scale. The mean is the value that keeps the data in 
                    balance, like in the picture below.</p>
                
                <image source = "images/120_Data_Screenshot9.png">
        <description>A scale with one large block to left of the fulcrum and two smaller blocks to the 
            right of the fulcrum.</description></image>

                <p>If we graph our household data, the $5 million data value is so far out to the right that the mean has 
                    to adjust up to keep things in balance.</p>
                
                <image source = "images/120_Data_Screenshot10.png">
        <description>A fourth block has been added to the scale, much further to the right than the others.
            The moves the center of balance so the orginal three blocks are to the left of the fulcrum
            and the new block is to the right of the fulcrum.</description></image>

        <p>For this reason, when working with data that have outliers - values far outside the primary grouping - it is 
            common to use a different measure of center, the median.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Median</title>
            <p>The <term>median</term> is the value separating the higher half of a dataset from the lower lower half
                of the dataset.</p>
            <p>To find the median, begin by listing the data in order from smallest to largest, or largest to 
                smallest.</p>
            <p>If the number of data values, <m>N</m>, is odd, then the median is the middle data value. This value can be 
                found by rounding <m>\frac{N}{2}</m> up to the next whole number.</p>

            <p>If the number of data values is even, there is no one middle value, so we find the mean of the two middle 
                values (values <m>\frac{N}{2}</m> and <m>\frac{N}{2}+1</m>).</p>
        </definition>

            <example>
                <p>Returning to the football touchdown data, we would start by listing the data in order. Luckily, it was 
                    already in decreasing order, so we can work with it without needing to reorder it first.</p>

                <p>37 33 33 32 29 28 28 23 22 22 22 21 21 21 20</p>

                <p>20 19 19 18 18 18 18 16 15 14 14 14 12 12 9 6</p>

                <solution>

                    <p>Since there are 31 data values, an odd number, the median will be the middle number, the 16th data 
                        value (<m>\frac{31}{2} = 15.5</m>), round up to 16, leaving 15 values below and 15 above). The 
                        16th data 
                        value is 20, so the median number of touchdown passes in the 2000 season was 20 passes. Notice 
                        that for this data, the median is fairly close to the mean we calculated earlier, 20.5.</p>

        <example>
            <p>Find the median of these quiz scores: 5 10 8 6 4 8 2 5 7 7</p>

            <solution>
                <p>We start by listing the data in order: 2 4 5 5 6 7 7 8 8 10</p>

                <p>Since there are 10 data values, an even number, there is no one middle number. So we find the mean of 
                    the two middle numbers, 6 and 7, and get <m>\frac{6+7}{2}=6.5</m></p>
                
                <p>The median quiz score was 6.5.</p>

            <answer>First we put the data in order: $3.29, $3.59, $3.75, $3.79, $3.99. Since there are an odd number of

                <p>From this we can tell that values 50 and 51 will be $35 thousand, and the mean of these two values is 
                    $35 thousand. The median income in this neighborhood is $35 thousand.</p>

        <example><p>If we add in the new neighbor with a $5 million household income, then there will be 101 data values, 
            and the 51st value will be the median. As we discovered in the last example, the 51st value is $35 thousand. 
            Notice that the new neighbor did not affect the median in this case. The median is not swayed as much by 
            outliers as the mean is.</p>
        </example>

        <p>In addition to the mean and the median, there is one other common measurement of the "typical" value of a data 
            set: the mode.</p>

        <definition><title>Mode</title>
            <p>The <term>mode</term> is the element of the data set that occurs most frequently.</p>
        </definition>

        <p>The mode is fairly useless with data like weights or heights where there are a large number of possible values. 
            The mode is most commonly used for categorical data, for which median and mean cannot be computed.</p>

        <title>Measures of Variation</title>
    
    <p>Consider these three sets of quiz scores:</p>

    <p>Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5</p>
    <p>Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10</p>
    <p>Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6</p>

    <p>All three of these sets of data have a mean of 5 and median of 5, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite 
        different. In section A, everyone had the same score; in section B half the class got no points and the other half 
        got a perfect score, assuming this was a 10-point quiz. Section C was not as consistent as section A, but not as 
        widely varied as section B.</p>

    <p>In addition to the mean and median, which are measures of the "typical" or "middle" value, we also need a measure 
        of how "spread out" or varied each data set is.</p>

    <p>There are several ways to measure this "spread" of the data. The first is the simplest and is called the range.</p>

    <definition><title>Range</title>
        <p>The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the data set.</p>
    </definition>

    <example>
        <p>Using the quiz scores from above,</p>

        <p>For section A, the range is 0 since both maximum and minimum are 5 and <m>5-5=0</m></p>

        <p>For section B, the range is 10 since <m>10-0=10</m></p>

        <p>For section C, the range is 2 since <m>6-4=2</m></p>
    </example>

    <p>In the last example, the range seems to be revealing how spread out the data is. However, suppose we add a fourth 
        section, Section D, with scores 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10.</p>

    <p>This section also has a mean and median of 5. The range is 10, yet this data set is quite different than Section B. 
        To better illuminate the differences, we’ll have to turn to more sophisticated measures of variation.</p>
    
    <note><title>Standard Deviation</title>
        <p>The standard deviation is a measure of variation based on measuring how far each data value deviates, or is \
            different, from the mean. A few important characteristics:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard deviation is always positive. Standard deviation will be zero if all the data values are equal, 
                and will get larger as the data spreads out.</li>
            <li>Standard deviation has the same units as the original data.</li>
            <li>Standard deviation, like the mean, can be highly influenced by outliers.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </note>
    
    <p>Using the data from section D, we could compute for each data value the difference between the data value and the 
        mean:</p>

        </tabular>
    </table>
    
    <p>We would like to get an idea of the "average" deviation from the mean, but if we find the average of the values in 
        the second column the negative and positive values cancel each other out (this will always happen), so to prevent 
        this we square every value in the second column:</p>

    <p>We then add the squared deviations up to get <m>25+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+25=50</m>. Ordinarily we would then divide by 
        the number of scores, <m>n</m>, (in this case, 10) to find the mean of the deviations. But we only do this if the 
        data set represents a population; if the data set represents a sample (as it almost always does), we instead 
        divide by <m>n-1</m> (in this case, <m>10-1=9</m>).</p>
    
    <p>So in our example, we would have <m>\frac{50}{10}=5</m> if section D represents a population and <m>\frac{50}{9}=
        5.56</m> if section D represents a sample. These values (5 and 5.56) are called, respectively, the population 
        variance and the sample variance for section D.</p>

    <p>Variance can be a useful statistical concept, but note that the units of variance in this instance would be points-
        squared since we squared all of the deviations. What are points-squared? Good question. We would rather deal with 
        the units we started with (points in this case), so to convert back we take the square root and get:</p>
    
        <p>population standard deviation = <m>\sqrt{\frac{50}{10}}=\sqrt{5} \approx 2.2</m></p>

        <p>sample standard deviation = <m>\sqrt{\frac{50}{9}} \approx 2.4</m></p>

    <p>If we are unsure whether the data set is a sample or a population, we will usually assume it is a sample, and we 
        will round answers to one more decimal place than the original data, as we have done above.</p>
    
    <note><title>Computing Standard Deviation</title>
        <p>To compute standard deviation:</p>
        <p>
        <ol label = "1">
            <li>Find the deviation of each data from the mean. In other words, subtract the mean from the data value.</li>

            <li>Add the squared deviations.</li>
            <li>Divide by <m>n</m>, the number of data values, if the data represents a whole population; divide by

        <p>If we want to compare standard deviations of different datasets, with different means, we have to compute
            the <term>coefficient of varation</term>. The coefficient of variation gives information about how large the 
            standard deviation is relative to the mean.</p>
        
        <definition><title>Coefficient of Variation</title>
            <p>For a dataset with a mean value of <m>\mu</m> and and standard deviation of <m>s</m>, the coefficient
                of variation is:</p>
            <me>CV = \frac{s}{\mu} \cdot 100\%</me>
        </definition>
        
        <example>
            <p>You are comparing stock prices for two different stocks over the past year.</p>
            <p>Stock A has mean price of $3.50 per share with a standard deviation of $0.30.</p>
            <p>Stock B has mean price of $8 per share with a standard deviation of $0.50.</p>

                </ol>
                </p>

        </example>
        
        <p>Where standard deviation is a measure of variation based on the mean, quartiles are based on the median.</p>

        <defintion><title>Quartiles</title>
            <p>Quartiles are values that divide the data in quarters.</p>
            <p>The first quartile (<m>Q_1</m>) is the value so that 25% of the data values are below it; the third 
                quartile (<m>Q_3</m>) is the value so that 75% of the data values are below it. You may have guessed that 
                the second quartile is the same as the median, since the median is the value so that 50% of the data 
                values are below it.</p>

            <p>This divides the data into quarters; 25% of the data is between the minimum and <m>Q_1</m>, 25% is between 
                <m>Q_1</m> and the median, 25% is between the median and <m>Q_3</m>, and 25% is between <m>Q_3</m> and the 
                maximum value.</p>
        </defintion>
        
        <p>While quartiles are not a 1-number summary of variation like standard deviation, the quartiles are used with 
            the median, minimum, and maximum values to form a 5 number summary of the data.</p>

        <definition><title>Five number summary</title><p>The five number summary takes this form:</p>
            <p>Minimum, <m>Q_1</m>, Median, <m>Q_3</m>, Maximum</p>
        </definition>

            <p>To find the first quartile, we need to find the data value so that 25% of the data is below it. If <m>n</m> 
                is the number of data values, we compute a locator by finding 25% of <m>n</m>. If this locator is a 
                decimal value, we round up, and find the data value in that position. If the locator is a whole number, we 
                find the mean of the data value in that position and the next data value. This is identical to the process 
                we used to find the median, except we use 25% of the data values rather than half the data values as the 
                locator.</p>
            
             <note><title>Finding <m>Q_1</m></title>
                <p>To find the first quartile, <m>Q_1</m>:</p>
                <p>Begin by ordering the data from smallest to largest</p>
                <p>Compute the locator: <m>L=0.25n</m></p>
                <p>If L is a decimal value: Round up to <m>L+</m></p>
                <p>Use the data value in the <m>L+^{th}</m> position</p>
                <p>If L is a whole number: Find the mean of the data values in the <m>L^{th}</m> and <m>L+1^{th}</m>

            <note><title>Finding <m>Q_3</m></title>
                <p>To find the third quartile, <m>Q_3</m>:</p>
                <p>Use the same procedure as for <m>Q_1</m>, but with locator:<m>L=0.75n</m></p>
            </note>

            <p>Examples should help make this clearer.</p>
        
        <example>
            <p>Suppose we have measured 9 females and their heights (in inches), sorted from smallest to largest are:</p>

            <p>59 60 62 64 66 67 69 70 72</p>

            <p>To find the first quartile we first compute the locator: 25% of 9 is <m>L=0.25\cdot 9=2.25</m>. 
                Since this value is not a whole number, we round up to 3.</p> 
            <p>The first quartile will be the third data value: 62 inches.</p>

            <p>To find the third quartile, we again compute the locator: 75% of 9 is <m>0.75 \cdot 9=6.75</m>. Since this 
                value is not a whole number, we round up to 7.</p>
            <p>The third quartile will be the seventh data value: 69 inches.</p>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>Suppose we had measured 8 females and their heights (in inches), sorted from smallest to largest are:</p>

            <p>59 60 62 64 66 67 69 70</p>

            <p>To find the first quartile we first compute the locator: 25% of 8 is <m>L=0.25(8)=2</m>.</p> 
            
            <p>Since this value is a whole number, we will find the mean of the 2nd and 3rd data values: 
                <m>\frac{60+62}{2} = 61</m>, so the first quartile is 61 inches.</p>
            
            <p>The third quartile is computed similarly, using 75% instead of 25%. <m>L=0.75(8)=6</m>.</p> 
            
            <p>This is a whole number, so we will find the mean of the 6th and 7th data values: <m>\frac{67+69}{2}=68</m>,
                so <m>Q_3</m> is 68.</p>
        </example>
        
        <p>Note that the median could be computed the same way, using 50%.</p>

        <p>The 5-number summary combines the first and third quartile with the minimum, median, and maximum values.</p>

        <example>
            <p>For the 9 female sample, the median is 66, the minimum is 59, and the maximum is 72. The 5 number summary 
                is: 59, 62, 66, 69, 72.</p>

            <p>For the 8 female sample, the median is 65, the minimum is 59, and the maximum is 70, so the 5 number 
                summary would be: 59, 61, 65, 68, 70.</p>
        </example>
        
        <example>
            <p>Returning to our quiz score data. In each case, the first quartile locator is <m>0.25\cdot 10=2.5</m>, so 
                the first quartile will be the 3rd data value, and the third quartile will be the 8th data value. Creating 
                the five-number summaries:</p>

            <p>Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5; 5-number summary: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5</p>
            <p>Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10; 5-number summary: 0, 0, 5, 10, 10</p>
            <p>Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6; 5-number summary: 4, 4, 5, 6, 6</p>
            <p>Section D: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 10; 5-number summary: 0, 5, 5, 5, 10</p>
        </example>

        <p>Of course, with a relatively small data set, finding a five-number summary is a bit silly, since the summary 
            contains almost as many values as the original data.</p>

            <p>A box plot is a graphical representation of a five-number summary.</p>
        </note>
        
        <p>To create a box plot, a number line is first drawn. A box is drawn from the first quartile to the third 
            quartile, and a line is drawn through the box at the median. “Whiskers” are extended out to the minimum and 
            maximum values.</p>

        <example>

            <p>The box plot below is based on the 9 female height data with 5 number summary:</p>

            <p>59, 62, 66, 69, 72</p>

<p>Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died 
appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived.  In fact, we can see 
that the median birth weight of infants that survived is the same as the third quartile of the 
    infants that died.</p> 
 
<p>Similarly, we can see that the first quartile of the survivors is larger than the median weight 
of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the 
    median birth weight of those that died.</p>  
 
<p>Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we 
can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that 
    died.</p>
 
<p>The box plot gives us a quick, albeit informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite 
    likely linked to survival of infants with SIRDS.</p>

                <p>The mean price of a dozen eggs is $2.19 with a standard deviation of $0.09. The mean price of 
                    a pound of chicken is $5.89 with a standard deviation of $0.15. Which item had more 
                    variability in prices? Explain.</p>
            </statement>
            
            <solution>
                <p>The coefficient of variation for the eggs is:
                    <me>CV = \frac{s}{\mu} \times 100\% = \frac{0.09}{2.19} \times 100\% = 4.1\%</me>
                    
                    The coefficient of varation for the chicken is:
                    
                    <me>CV = \frac{0.15}{5.89} \times 100\% = 2.5\%</me>
                    
                    Since the coefficient of varation is larger for the eggs, there is more variability in 
                    egg prices than chicken.</p>
            </solution>
            
            <answer>The eggs have a larger variability in price because they have a larger 
                coefficient of variation.</answer>

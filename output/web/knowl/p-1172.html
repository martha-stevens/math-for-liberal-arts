<div class="para">One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term loans.  For longer term loans, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.  In that case, interest would be earned regularly.  For example, bonds are essentially a loan made to the bond issuer (a company or government) by you, the bond holder.  In return for the loan, the issuer agrees to pay interest, often annually.  Bonds have a maturity date, at which time the issuer pays back the original bond value.</div>

<div class="para">We can often classify items as belonging to sets. If you went the library to search for a book and they asked you to express your search using unions, intersections, and complements of sets, that would feel a little strange. Instead, we typically use words like “and”, “or”, and “not” to connect our keywords together to form a search. These words, which form the basis of Boolean logic, are directly related to our set operations. (Boolean logic was developed by the 19th-century English mathematician George Boole.)</div>

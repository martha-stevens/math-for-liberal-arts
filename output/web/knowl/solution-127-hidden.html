<div class="para">Using the Basic Counting Rule, there are 25 choices for the first person, 24 remaining choices for the second person and 23 for the third, so there are  <span class="process-math">\(25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23=13,800\)</span> ways to choose three people. Suppose for a moment that Abe is chosen first, Bea second and Cindy third; this is one of the 13,800 possible outcomes. Another way to award the prizes would be to choose Abe first, Cindy second and Bea third; this is another of the 13,800 possible outcomes. But either way Abe, Bea and Cindy each get $50, so it doesn't really matter the order in which we select them. In how many different orders can Abe, Bea and Cindy be selected? It turns out there are 6:</div> <div class="para">ABC ACB BAC BCA CAB CBA</div> <div class="para">How can we be sure that we have counted them all? We are really just choosing 3 people out of 3, so there are <span class="process-math">\(3\cdot 2\cdot 1=6\)</span> ways to do this; we didn't really need to list them all, we can just use permutations!</div> <div class="para">So, out of the 13,800 ways to select 3 people out of 25, six of them involve Abe, Bea and Cindy. The same argument works for any other group of three people (say Abe, Bea and David or Frank, Gloria and Hildy) so each three-person group is counted six times. Thus the 13,800 figure is six times too big. The number of distinct three-person groups will be <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3,800}{6}=2300\)</span>

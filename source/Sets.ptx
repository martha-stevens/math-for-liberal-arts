                <p>It is natural for us to classify items into groups, or sets, and consider how those sets overlap
                    with each other. We can use these sets understand relationships between groups, and to
                    analyze survey data.</p>
                <p>An art collector might own a collection of paintings, while a music lover might keep a
                    collection of CDs. Any collection of items can form a <term>set</term>.</p>
                <definition xml:id="Def-Set">
                    <title>Set</title>
                    <p> A <term>set</term> is a collection of distinct objects, called <term>elements</term> of the set</p>
                    <p>A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elements of the set,
                        enclosed in curly brackets.</p>
                </definition>
                
                <example>
                <p>Some examples of sets defined by describing the contents:
                    <ol label = "a">
                        <li>The set of all even numbers</li>
                        <li>The set of all books written about travel to Chile</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Some examples of sets defined by listing the elements of the set:
                    <ol label ="a">
                        <li>{1, 3, 9, 12}</li>
                        <li>{red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple}</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                </example>
                
                <p>A set simply specifies the contents; order is not important. The set represented by {1, 2, 3} is
                    equivalent to the set {3, 1, 2}.</p>
                
                <remark><title>Notation</title>
                    <p>Commonly, we will use a variable to represent a set, to make it easier to refer to that set
                    later.</p>
                    <p>The symbol <m>\in</m> means <q>is an element of</q>.</p>
                    <p>A set that contains no elements, { }, is called the empty set and is notated <m>\emptyset</m>.</p>
                </remark>
                
                <example>
                    <p>Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}</p>
                    <p>To notate that 2 is element of the set, we’d write <m>2 \in A</m>.</p>
                </example>
                
                <p>Sometimes a collection might not contain all the elements of a set. For example, Chris owns
                three Madonna albums. While Chris’s collection is a set, we can also say it is a <term>subset</term> of the
                larger set of all Madonna albums.</p>
                
                <definition xml:id="def-subset"><title>Subset</title>
                    <p>A <term>subset</term> of a set A is another set that contains only elements from the set A, but may
                        not contain all the elements of A.</p>
                    <p>If B is a subset of A, we write <m>B \subseteq A</m></p>
                    <p>A <term>proper subset</term> is a subset that is not identical to the original set - it contains fewer
                        elements.</p>
                    <p>If B is a proper subset of A, we write <m>B \subset A</m></p>
                </definition>
                
                <example>
                    <p>Consider these three sets</p>
                    <p><m>A = </m>the set of all even numbers, <m>B = \{2, 4, 6\}</m>, <m>C = \{2, 3, 4, 6\}</m></p>
                    <p>Here <m>B \subset A</m> since every element of <m>B</m> is also an even number, so is an element of <m>A</m></p>
                    <p>More formally, we could say <m>B \subset A</m> since if <m>x \in B</m>, then <m>x \in A</m>.</p>
                    <p>It is also true that <m>B \subset C</m>.</p>
                    <p>C is not a subset of <m>A</m>, since <m>C</m> contains an element, 3, that is not contained in <m>A</m>.</p>
                </example>
                
                <example>
                    <p>Suppose a set contains the plays “Much Ado About Nothing”, “MacBeth”, and “A
                        Midsummer’s Night Dream”. What is a larger set this might be a subset of?</p>
                    <solution>There are many possible answers here. One would be the set of plays by Shakespeare. This
                    is also a subset of the set of all plays ever written. It is also a subset of all British literature.</solution>
                </example>
                
                <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                    <p>The set <m>A = \{1, 3, 5\}</m>. What is a larger set this might be a subset of?</p>
                    <answer>There are several answers: The set of all odd numbers less than 10. The set of all odd
                        numbers. The set of all integers. The set of all real numbers. </answer>
                </problem>
                
                <p>Often times we are interested in the number of items in a set or subset. This is called the 
                    <term>cardinality</term> of the set.</p>
                
                <definition><title>Cardinality</title>
                    <p>The number of elements in a set is the <term>cardinality</term> of that set.</p>
                    <p>The cardinality, or cardinal number, of the set A is often notated as <m>n\left(A\right)</m>.</p>
                </definition>

            <defintion xml:id="def-universalset"><title>Universal Set</title>
                <p>A <term>universal set</term> is a set that contains all the elements we are interested in. This would have to be defined by the context.</p>
                <p>A complement is relative to the universal set, so <m>A^C</m> contains all the elements in the universal set that are not in <m>A</m>.</p>
            </defintion>

            <example>

                <ol label ="a">
                    <li>If we were discussing searching for books, the universal set might be all the books in the library.</li>
                    <li>If we were grouping your Facebook friends, the universal set would be all your Facebook friends.</li>
                    <li>If you were working with sets of numbers, the universal set might be all whole numbers, all integers, or all real numbers.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

            <example>
                <p>Suppose the universal set is <m>U</m> = all whole numbers from 1 to 9. If <m>A=\{1, 2, 4\}</m>, then
                <me>A^C = \{3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}</me></p>

            <p>As we saw earlier with the expression <m>A^C \cap C</m>, set operations can be grouped together.  Grouping symbols can be used like they are with arithmetic - to force an order of operations.</p>

                <p>To visualize the interaction of sets, John Venn in 1880 thought to use overlapping circles,
                building on a similar idea used by Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. These illustrations
                now called Venn Diagrams. </p>

                <p>Sometimes we may be interested in the cardinality of the union or intersection of sets, but not 
                    know the actual elements of each set. This is common in surveying. </p>
                
                <example>
                    <p>A survey asks 200 people “What beverage do you drink in the morning”, and offers choices:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tea only</li>
                        <li>Coffee only</li>
                        <li>Both coffee and tea</li>

                    <p>Suppose 20 report tea only, 80 report coffee only, 40 report both. How many people drink tea in the morning?

                    <p>This question can most easily be answered by creating a Venn diagram. We can see that we can find the people 
                        who drink tea by adding those who drink only tea to those who drink both: 60 people.</p>
                    
                    <p>We can also see that those who drink neither are those not contained in the any of the three other groupings, 
                        so we can count those by subtracting from the cardinality of the universal set, 200.</p>
                    
                    <p><m>200 - 20 - 80 - 40 = 60</m> people who drink neither.</p>

                <example>
                    <p>A survey asks: Which online services have you used in the last month:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Twitter</li>
                        <li>Facebook</li>
                        <li>Have used both</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>The results show 40% of those surveyed have used Twitter, 70% have used Facebook, and 20% have used both. 
                        How many people have used neither Twitter or Facebook?</p>
                    
                    <solution>
                    
                    <p>Let T be the set of all people who have used Twitter, and F be the set of all people who have used Facebook. 
                        Notice that while the cardinality of F is 70% and the cardinality of T is 40%, the cardinality of 
                        <m>F \cup T</m> is not simply 70% + 40%, since that would count those who use both services twice. 
                        To find the cardinality of <m>F \cup T</m>, we can add the cardinality of F and the cardinality of T, then 
                        subtract those in intersection that we’ve counted twice. In symbols,</p>
                    
                    <p><m>n\left(F \cup T\right) = n\left(F\right) + n\left(T\right) - n\left(F \cap T\right)</m></p>
                    <p><m>n\left(F \cup T\right) = 70\% + 40\% - 20\% = 90\%</m></p>
                    
                    <p>Now, to find how many people have not used either service, we’re looking for the cardinality of 
                        <m>\left(F \cup T\right)^C</m></p>
                    
                    <p>Since the universal set contains 100% of people and the cardinality of <m>F \cup T = 90\%</m>, 
                        the cardinality of <m>\left(F \cup T\right)^C</m> must be the other 10%.</p>
                        
                    </solution>
                    
                </example>
                
                <p>The previous example illustrated two important properties</p>

                </note>
                
                <p>Notice that the first property can also be written in an equivalent form by solving for the cardinality of the

                    <p>It might help to look at a Venn diagram. From the given data, we know that there are 3 students in region e 
                        and 7 students in region h.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since 7 students were taking a SS and NS course, we know that n(d) + n(e) = 7. Since we know there are 3 
                        students in region 3, there must be 7 - 3 = 4 students in region d.</p>
                    
                    <p>Similarly, since there are 10 students taking HM and NS, which includes regions e and f, there must be 
                        10 - 3 = 7 students in region f.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since 9 students were taking SS and HM, there must be 9 - 3 = 6 students in region b.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now, we know that 21 students were taking a SS course. This includes students from regions a, b, d, and e. 
                        Since we know the number of students in all but region a, we can determine that 21 - 6 - 4 - 3 = 8 students 
                        are in region a.</p>
                    
                    <p>8 students are taking only a SS course.</p>

                <problem><title>Try It Now</title>
                    <p>One hundred fifty people were surveyed and asked if they believed in UFOs, ghosts, and Bigfoot.</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>43 believed in UFOs</li>
                        <li>44 believed in ghosts</li>
                        <li>25 believed in Bigfoot</li>
                        <li>10 believed in UFOs and ghosts</li>
                        <li>8 believed in ghosts and Bigfoot</li>
                        <li>5 believed in UFOs and Bigfoot</li>
                        <li>2 believed in all three</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>How many people surveyed believed in none of these things?</p>
                    
                    <answer>
                        <p>Starting with the intersection of all three circles, we work our way out. Since 10 people believe in 
                            UFOs and Ghosts, and 2 believe in all three, that leaves 8 that believe in only UFOs and Ghosts. We 
                            work our way out, filling in all the regions. Once we have, we can add up all those regions, getting 91 
                            people in the union of all three sets. This leaves <m>150 - 91 = 59</m> who believe in none.</p>

                </problem>
                
                <example>
                    <p>A streaming service surveyed the viewing preferences of 50 users. The following information was obtained:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>10 want to watch movies, TV shows, and documentaries</li>
                        <li>16 want to watch movies and documentaries</li>
                        <li>11 only want to see movies</li>
                        <li>16 want to see movies but not documentaries</li>
                        <li>14 want to see TV shows and documentaries</li>
                        <li>27 want to see TV shows</li>
                        <li>40 want to see movies or documentaries</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Create a Venn diagram to descrive this data. Then determine the number of people who are only interested 
                        in watching documentaries.</p>

                    <image source ="images/120_Sets11_Screenshot.png"><description>Venn Diagram with labels from the 
                        problem.</description></image>
                    
                    <p>We can start by putting 10 in region e, since 10 people are interested in all three.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since 16 people want to see movies and documentaries, regions e and f must add up to 16. 16 - 10 = 6, 
                        so there are 6 people in region f.</p>
                    
                    <p>11 people only want to see movies, so region c must be 11.</p>
                    
                    <p>16 want to see movies, but not documentaries. This would include the part of circle M that is not overlapping
                        with circle D.  Regions b and c must add up to 16. There are 11 people in region c, so b = 16 - 11 = 5.</p>
                    
                    <p>14 want to see TV shows and documentaries. Regions d and e add up to 14, so d = 14 - 10 = 4.</p>
                    
                    <p>27 want to see TV shows.  Everything in the TV circle must add up to 27--that includes regions a, b, d, and e.
                        Region a = 27 - 5 - 10 - 4 = 8.</p>
                    
                    <p>40 want to see either movies or documentaries. <m>n\left(M \cup D\right)=40</m>, so the regions in sets M or D
                         must add up to 40. We already know regions b, c, d, e, and f.  Those add up to <m>5+11+4+10+6=36</m>, so there 
                        must be 4 people in region g.</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally, the sum of all the people inside the sets is 48. Since 50 people were surveyed there are 2 people 
                        in region h.</p>

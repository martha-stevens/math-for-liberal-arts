<div class="para">You can satisfy this condition by having Case A or Case B, as follows:</div> <div class="para">Case A) you can get the Ace of Diamonds first and then a black card or</div> <div class="para">Case B) you can get a black card first and then the Ace of Diamonds.</div> <div class="para">Let's calculate the probability of Case A. The probability that the first card is the Ace of Diamonds is  <span class="process-math">\(|frac{1}{52}\text{.}\)</span> The probability that the second card is black given that the first card is the Ace of Diamonds is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{26}{51}\)</span> because 26 of the remaining 51 cards are black. The probability is therefore <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{52}\cdot \frac{26}{51}=\frac{1}{102}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Now for Case B: the probability that the first card is black is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span> The probability that the second card is the Ace of Diamonds given that the first card is black is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{51}\text{.}\)</span> The probability of Case B is therefore <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{51}=
\frac{1}{102}\text{,}\)</span> the same as the probability of Case 1.</div> <div class="para">Recall that the probability of A or B is <span class="process-math">\(P\left( A \right) + P\left(B \right) - P\left(
A\text{ and }B\right)\)</span> and n this problem, <span class="process-math">\(P\left(A\text{ and }B\right)=0\)</span> since the first card cannot be the Ace of Diamonds and be a black card. Therefore, the probability of Case A or Case B is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{102}+\frac{1}{102}=\frac{2}{102}=\frac{1}{51}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The probability that you will get the Ace of Diamonds and a black card when drawing two cards from a deck is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{51}\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">The base of a percent is very important.  For example, while Nixon was president, it was argued that marijuana was a “gateway” drug, claiming that 80% of marijuana smokers went on to use harder drugs like cocaine.  The problem is, this isn’t true.  The true claim is that 80% of harder drug users first smoked marijuana.  The difference is one of base:  80% of marijuana smokers using hard drugs, vs. 80% of hard drug users having smoked marijuana. These numbers are not equivalent. As it turns out, only one in 2,400 marijuana users actually go on to use harder drugs.</div>

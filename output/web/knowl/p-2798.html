<div class="para">Like Jefferson’s method, Webster’s method carries a bias in favor of states with large populations, but rounding the quotas to the nearest whole number greatly reduces this bias. (Notice that Providence County, the largest, is the one that gets a representative trimmed because of the increased quota.) Also like Jefferson’s method, Webster’s method does not always follow the quota rule, but it follows the quota rule much more often than Jefferson’s method does. (In fact, if Webster’s method had been applied to every apportionment of Congress in all of American history, it would have followed the quota rule every single time.)</div>

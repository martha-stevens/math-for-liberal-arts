<div class="para">Note that we just used the word "typical" although in many cases you might think of using the word "average." We need to be careful with the word "average" as it means different things to different people in different contexts. One of the most common uses of the word "average" is what mathematicians and statisticians call the arithmetic mean, or just plain old mean for short. "Arithmetic mean" sounds rather fancy, but you have likely calculated a mean many times without realizing it; the mean is what most people think of when they use the word "average".</div>
